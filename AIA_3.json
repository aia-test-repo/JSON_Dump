However, many made strong recoveries on the day and stocks rallied off the lows. Let\u2019s look at a few top stock trades for Thursday.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nEthereum (CCC:ETH-USD) had been on a powerful rally not that long ago. However, it\u2019s been under pressure since topping out earlier this month and then finally broke down on Wednesday.\n\nAt the session low, Ethereum was down 37% today! However, from the lows, it\u2019s actually up 40%, curbing its one-day losses to \u201cjust\u201d 23% at the moment. The volatility has been wild, to say the least.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNow back above the 50-day and 10-week moving averages, bulls need to see Ethereum hold above these measures. At the very least, it has to hold above $2,550.\n\nIf ETH loses the $2,500 mark, we can\u2019t rule out a return to this week\u2019s low. Luckily, shares caught a bounce right where we had the breakout marked, near $2,000.\n-  7 High Quality Industrial Stocks to Buy Now \n\nOn the upside, however, let\u2019s see how Ethereum does on a test of its 10-day moving average. Above it could put the $3,500 mark and the 21-day moving average in play.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has been range bound since last summer, although $74 continues to hold as support.\n\nOn the upside, we want to see a rally back to $80, where AMD stock will find its 10-week and 50-week moving averages. Above these measures puts the 21-week on the table, followed by resistance at $88.\n\nOn a break below last week\u2019s low at $72.50, it\u2019s possible we see a move lower. In that scenario, keep an eye on the 21-month moving average. If for some reason AMD stock breaks below that measure, the $60 breakout level could be in play.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nWhile other retailers have struggled despite strong earnings results, Target (NYSE:TGT) is doing quite well.\n\nShares are pushing higher on Wednesday, running into its prior highs. From here I\u2019d love to see a push up to the 161.8% extension near $220. Above that puts the two-times range extension at $233 in play.\n-  7 Blue-Chip Stocks Looking Better Than Ever \n\nOn the downside, though, keep an eye on $210. Losing that mark likely puts it below the 10-day and 21-day moving averages, and puts the 10-week and 50-day moving averages on the table. For now, bulls are in control with this one.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nUnlike Target, TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) is not responding well to earnings. However, that\u2019s not the end of the world, either.\n\nShares are trading right down into the 21-week moving average, a measure that has been support all year. If it holds, look to see if TJX stock can reclaim the 10-week.\n\nIf it fails to do so, it\u2019s possible we see a retest of the pre-coronavirus highs near $65, with more support sitting in the low $60s.\n\nBack above $71, and TJX stock could retest the all-time highs.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nJD.com (NASDAQ:JD) was trading really well coming into 2021, but like other growth stocks, it has struggled mightily since topping out in mid-February.\n\nAfter cascading lower, JD stock quickly saw its short-term moving averages turn from support to resistance, while it failed to reclaim $85. This combination should have kept bulls out of the name.\n\nThen it failed to hold the $78 to $79 area and 50-week moving average, which also turned to resistance. Are you sensing a pattern?\n\nNow trying to hold last week\u2019s low near $66.50, let\u2019s navigate this one. On the upside, see how JD stock does on a retest of the $77 to $80 area, if it can get there. There it finds current resistance, but it also finds the 10-day, 10-month and 50-week moving averages.\n\nA close below $66.50 likely puts the 21-month moving average and the $60 area in play.\n\nOn the date of publication, Bret Kenwell held a long position in AMD.

The city currently has an \"opt in\" approach under which exchanges can apply to be licensed by the Securities and Futures Commission, but this is not compulsory.\u00a0\n\nThe city's Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) said on Friday that all virtual asset (VA) exchanges should be licensed if they wished to operate in Hong Kong.\n\nIt also added \"confining the services of a VA exchange to professional investors... is appropriate at least for the initial stage of the licensing regime.\"\n\nCryptocurrencies have been struggling to regain losses from a massive sell-off earlier in the week, which saw the crypto world lose 20% of its value as deep correction hit the market. Bitcoin fell below $32,000 on Wednesday, while ethereum dropped as much as 30%.\n\n\"Crypto holders who are hoping for a rapid bounce back from this week\u2019s dramatic falls, should buckle up and expect another rollercoaster ride, Streeter added. \"Sentiment has shifted not simply because powerful influencers like Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk have stepped back from being cheerleaders for bitcoin.\"\n"}, {"headline": "Market Wrap: China Breaks Crypto as Bitcoin Falls to $36K, ETH Drops $300 in Two Hours", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "CoinDesk via Yahoo Finance", "date": "20 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/VxMmaWmxKiuDQwHcD9RlDQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/coindesk_75/81fd17c16d722db0dd9507be3a8c02f3", "auther": "Daniel Cawrey", "body": "It has been a low-volume Friday to cap an up-and-down week for cryptocurrencies.

BTC was below the 10-hour moving average and the 50-day, a bearish signal for market technicians.\u00a0\n\nAccording to spot data from Bitstamp, BTC is headed for its second straight week declining 20% or more, on track for a 37% decline over the two-week period, on a par with March 2020\u2019s market bloodbath.\u00a0\n\nRelated: The May 19 Sell-Off Actually Strengthened Bitcoin&#8217;s Narrative\n\nThe main catalyst for the move down Friday was a statement from a China\u2019s State Council on BTC: \u201cWe should crack down on bitcoin mining and trading activities and prevent individual risks from being passed to the whole society.\u201d\n\nWithin two hours, bitcoin fell from $41,454 around 14:15 UTC (10:15 a.m. ET) to as low as $36,880, an 11% decrease, based on CoinDesk 20 data.

At around $4 billion Friday, volume has decreased 75% decrease from $16 billion in volume on Wednesday, based on CoinDesk Research\u2019s data on eight major spot bitcoin exchanges.\n\nRelated: CME Returns to Second Place in Latest Rankings of Bitcoin Futures Exchanges\n\nNeil Van Huis, director of sales and institutional trading at crypto market maker Blockfills, says \u201cconsolidation,\u201d a period of low volume and subsequent price discovery due to lack of liquidity, might be a market factor this weekend.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m anticipating some consolidation where markets may have previously broken out from,\u201d said Van Huis. \u201cI think the market appears to be digesting the move down in a very fair fashion and we will soon know what it wants to do next.\u201d\n\nRead More: Institutional Bitcoin Buying Spiked Around Wednesday\u2019s Crash\n\nIn the bitcoin derivatives market over 16,700 BTC is centered on a $50,000 strike price, the highest open interest. However, the split between puts and calls is almost even. A put is a right but not an obligation to sell an asset while a call is the right but not an obligation to buy an asset \u2013 both within a specific time frame, known as expiration.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s an intriguing development because bitcoin has not been at the $50,000 price level in over a week and it\u2019s possibly a sign smart options traders are taking both sides of the trade at that level.\n\n\u201cThe open interest doesn\u2019t indicate directionality,\u201d noted Vishal Shah, founder of crypto derivatives exchange Alpha5.\n\nSince the beginning of April, 30-day volatility for 10 brand-name crypto assets on the CoinDesk 20 have all climbed, including bitcoin. However, it is ethereum classic (ETC) and ether that are in the stratosphere of wild price gyrations. Both assets have over 30-day volatility at 250% as of closing data from Thursday.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe part that stands out the most is that volatility has exploded recently, with many assets experiencing over 200% realized, which is huge,\u201d said Rich Rosenblum, president of crypto market maker GSR. \u201cThen, at the same time, BTC volatility is elevated vs. its lull a few weeks ago, but certainly muted relative to the rest, staying at under 100%.\u201d\n\nGreg Magadini, chief executive officer, Genesis Volatility, noted that ETH\u2019s \u201cDVOL\u201d metric, which is a volatility measure similar to traditional markets\u2019 VIX and tracked by options exchange Deribit, is up to 180. It\u2019s record high was Thursday, at 190. He says realized volatility, which is derived from analyzing historical returns, is now priced into the market.\u00a0\n\n\u201cAlthough we\u2019ve come down from peak realized volatility seen in the past few days, over +300%, volatility is known to cluster,\u201d said Magadini. \u201cThe options markets are pricing in over +100% implied volatility for all expirations and about 150% for near-dated options.\u201d\n\nEther, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was trading around $2,363 as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET), slipping 15.5% over the prior 24 hours. The asset is below the 10-hour moving average as well as the 50-day, a bearish signal for market technicians.\u00a0\n\nEther dumped from $2,740 around 14:15 UTC (10:15 a.m. ET) to $2,426 by 16:15 UTC (12:15 p.m. ET), a $314 decrease based on CoinDesk 20 data. ETH is still slipping, at $2,363 as of press time.\u00a0\n\nNick Mancini, research analyst at crypto sentiment analytics platform Trade the Chain, says major blockchain assets like bitcoin and ether are still seen positively, despite recent price dumps and volatility jumps.\u00a0\n\n\u201cGoing forward, long-term sentiment scores for most crypto, especially bitcoin and ether, are still high, in the 70s, despite all of the recent turmoil,\u201d Mancini. \u201cwhich means the bullish thesis remains intact.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe bullish thesis may be holding overall, but traders have clearly been losing some interest in ether versus other cryptocurrencies. Ether\u2019s dominance, its share of the greater cryptocurrency market, has started to drop.

It touched a low of $31,663.46 before recovering to trade just above $37,000. That level still marked a fall of 15% on the day.\n\nBitcoin's slump hit confidence in the broader market. Ethereum (ETH-USD), the world's second biggest cryptocurrency, fell as much as 30% at one point. By mid-afternoon, it was still down 22% to trade at $2,642.\n\nDate provider CoinMarketCap.com was reporting that the value of the entire cryptocurrency market had fallen by 20% over the 24 hours. The sell-off wiped approximately $350bn off the market's value.\u00a0\n\nThe price declines coincided with a renewed crackdown on cryptocurrencies from the People\u2019s Bank of China. The central bank issued a statement on its WeChat account reiterating that financial institutions should not accept or deal with cryptocurrencies, the Financial Times reported.\n\n\"China has for some time been putting pressure on the crypto space, but this marks an intensification,\" said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com. \"Other countries might follow now as central banks make strides towards their own digital currencies.\"\n\nWatch: What is bitcoin?\n\nWednesday's slump extended a slide that began last week after Tesla (TSLA) boss Elon Musk announced his company would no longer pursue plans to accept bitcoin as payment for its electrical cars. Musk \u2014 a long-time crypto advocate \u2014 cited environmental concerns. Dogecoin (DOGE-USD), a Musk favourite, was down 21% on Wednesday to $0.37.\n\nMusk signalled some support for bitcoin as selling gripped the market. The billionaire tweeted emojis signalling Tesla had \"diamond hands\" \u2014 crypto-speak for a person or company that will hold on to a position no matter what. Tesla disclosed a $1.5bn investment in bitcoin earlier this year, although it has since sold some of its holding.\n\nTesla has \ud83d\udc8e \ud83d\ude4c\n\n\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 19, 2021\n\nRead more: Bitcoin, Dogecoin sink after Elon Musk walks back Tesla's support for crypto transactions\n\nBitcoin has fallen over 35% since Musk's publicly said Tesla was abandoning its payment plans. It is now around 45% below record highs reached earlier in the year. The cryptocurrency remains up 15% since the start of the year, following a spectacular rally that began last October.\n\nBitcoin's run-up was initially fuelled by the embrace of mainstream institutions. Banks, payment companies like Square (SQ) and PayPal (PYPL), and tech businesses such as Tesla or MicroStrategy (MSTR) all announced they were either working with or investing in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. MicroStrategy has put over $2bn into bitcoin and this week invested another $10m into buying into the price dip. Shares in the company slumped 11% at the open in New York.\n\nRead more: How bad is bitcoin for the environment?\n\nMore recently, crypto gains have been fuelled by retail investors piling into the market to take advantage of price momentum.

Sentiment was hit by continued concerns over inflation.\n\nRead more: Why are investors afraid of inflation?\u00a0\n\nRecent crypto price declines have sparked angry debate and recriminations among small time investors. Still, many institutional investors and analysts who follow the space remain optimistic about its long-term prospects.\n\n\"Bitcoin's pattern over the last 10 years has been meteoric rises followed by pull-backs,\" said Joe DiPasquale, chief executive of BitBull Capital. \"The trends has been higher highs and higher lows: one year ago today, bitcoin closed at $9,927 while it now sits at about $39K.\u00a0\n\n\"While it's certainly fallen from its $63K high, that is still a 300% rise. The fall in price is a natural consolidation period that we see as necessary for the support lines to form for future appreciation.

The answer is, for those watching closely, it likely strengthened it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s why: bitcoin proved itself on Wednesday when it saw its second biggest volume day of the year, and market infrastructure did not break. Some exchanges suffered outages, but liquidity was available, as spot volumes show. Moreover, while a drop of over 30% may be dizzying for new buyers high on hopium, such events are not uncommon in bitcoin\u2019s bull-market history.\n\nThe chart above shows bitcoin-dollar volume on the 11 exchanges that are eligible as components of the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX). That means these markets are accessible to U.S. investors, have transparent ownership and do not place limits on bitcoin or dollar withdrawals, among other criteria.\u00a0\n\nRelated: CME Returns to Second Place in Latest Rankings of Bitcoin Futures Exchanges\n\nThe chart shows how the May 19 selloff compared, in bitcoin terms, to volume traded in the Jan. 10 selloff, as Dogecoin and GameStop mania peaked on Jan. 22, and during a second sell-off in February.\n\nThe bitcoin-dollar markets in general are useful to watch, because they can indicate activity at a well-known market entry point \u2013 a place where new entrants \u201cbuying the dip\u201d are likely to place orders.\u00a0\n\nMore narrowly, XBX eligibility means these exchanges can attract institutional activity as well. In particular, LMAX Digital serves institutional clients exclusively, and Coinbase (marked here as Coinbase Pro) volume is 64% institutional, according to the company\u2019s latest earnings report.\n\n(To get insights like this in your inbox every Monday,\u00a0sign up for CoinDesk Indexes\u2019 weekly newsletter, \u201cThe Hard Fork\u201d.)\n\nRelated: Market Wrap: China Breaks Crypto as Bitcoin Falls to $36K, ETH Drops $300 in Two Hours\n\nCoinbase specifically set records on Wednesday, handling over $4 billion in notional BTC/USD volume for the first time. (It was not a record in bitcoin units. That record was set Dec. 13 2015, when 165,543 BTC changed hands on Coinbase dollar markets. For context, December 2015 saw bitcoin trading up into the $400s, four months into a bull market that would last through December 2017.) Coinbase ETH/USD markets also handled record volume in both ETH and dollar terms on Wednesday, 1.7 million ETH valued in aggregate at $4.5 billion.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe fact that spot market volume can crescendo like this is an indicator of market maturity, at least in these two blue-chip cryptocurrencies: capital is able to flow in as the price drops, and sellers are finding buyers on the way down.\u00a0\n\nMeanwhile, in offshore derivatives markets, all was normal. Wednesday put this week over $4 billion in bitcoin futures liquidations.\u00a0\n\nAs this chart, pulled Thursday from skew.com, shows, this past week was only the third highest week for liquidations so far in 2021, and it\u2019s the fourth time this year that bitcoin futures liquidations have crossed $4 billion in notional value. Offshore futures markets did not artificially flash-crash the price.\u00a0\n\nWednesday\u2019s bitcoin price drop was swifter and deeper than any so far this year. The CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX) low, struck in the wee hours UTC time at $30,037.61, was 54% off its all-time high, 41% off its price before Elon started tweeting and 30% off the prior day\u2019s closing price at midnight UTC.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s the third time this year bitcoin has entered \u201cbear market\u201d territory, by equity markets\u2019 rule of thumb, which is a 20% drop. The two prior occasions occurred as the XBX made its way to its current all-time high ($64,888.19, set on April 14). Some bear market.\n\nOn any time scale, a 30% intra-day drop is unusual for bitcoin. Matt Weller of forex.com presented this illustrative chart Wednesday afternoon on All About Bitcoin on CoinDesk TV.\u00a0\n\nThe chart shows how, in the bull market that began in the second half of 2015, bitcoin saw eight drawdowns of 30% or more. None of them took place in the course of a single 24-hour day. But they all took place during a longer upward trend that took bitcoin\u2019s price from $200 to $20,000.\n\nThe current bull market dates back to March 2020, when bitcoin hit a yearly low of $3,905. If this bull market grows to resemble that period, it will put bitcoin on course to hit the $400,000 mark by July 2022. That\u2019s a big if, but also a popular one.\n- Ray Dalio, Wall Street\u2019s \u2018Oddest Duck,\u2019 Shares the Bitcoin Mind\n- \u2018Grayscale Discount\u2019 Narrows to 10% and Could Shrink More as Lockups Expire\n"}, {"headline": "Stock market news live updates: Stocks log third straight day of losses as technology stocks slide", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Yahoo Finance", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/LOkwytjIRJzVmBpUe__YZQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/df099790-97d8-11eb-bffb-90dd619e59aa", "auther": "Emily McCormick", "body": "Stocks logged a third straight day of declines as inflation concerns persisted.\n\n[Click here to read what's moving markets heading into Thursday, May 20]\n\nThe Nasdaq underperformed, and the index opened lower by more than 1.5% before paring some losses.

The moves lower extended a recent bout of volatility and were exacerbated after the People's Bank of China doubled down on its stance that cryptocurrencies could not be used for payments. \n\nLeadership in equity markets has see-sawed between cyclical and value stocks and technology shares, as investors consider prospects for a strong economic rebound, but also the possibility that the pick-up in activity generates a surge in inflation that ultimately weighs on the recovery.

However, the minutes covered the Federal Open Market Committee's meeting from before the release of the much weaker-than-expected April jobs report and government print showing a much greater-than-expected increase in consumer prices, rendering them somewhat outdated.\u00a0\n\n\u2014\n\nHere were the main moves in markets as of 4:03 p.m. ET:\n- S&P 500 (^GSPC): -12.04 (-0.29%) to 4,115.79\n- Dow (^DJI): -163.17 (-0.48%) to 33,897.49\n- Nasdaq (^IXIC): -3.90 (-0.03%) to 13,299.74\n- Crude (CL=F): -$2.17 (-3.31%) to $63.32 a barrel\n- Gold (GC=F): +$3.60 (+0.19%) to $1,871.60 per ounce\n- 10-year Treasury (^TNX): +4.1 bps to yield 1.6830%\n\n\u2014\n\nThe Federal Reserve's April meeting minutes Wednesday afternoon reinforced that most Federal Open Market Committee members did not think QE tapering or rate increases were needed in the near-term, given the distance the economy still needs to make up to reach the Fed's employment and price stability goals.\u00a0\n\n\"Participants observed that economic activity had picked up sharply this year, with robust gains in consumer spending, housing-sector activity, business equipment investment, and manufacturing production,\" according to the minutes. \"They noted that the acceleration in economic activity reflected positive developments associated with the rapid pace of vaccinations as well as continued support from fiscal and monetary policies. Nevertheless, participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee\u2019s maximum-employment and price-stability goals.\"\u00a0\n\n\u2014\n\nWednesday's stock drop put the three major indexes on pace for a third straight day of losses, as well as their fifth down day over the past seven sessions. However, some strategists said the pullback was to be expected given the strength of the run-up so far this year up until May, and noted it did not reflect a worsening in economic or company fundamentals.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe pullback here has gotten a little deeper over the last couple of trading sessions, not necessarily threatening technically important lines of support,\u201d Mark Luschini, Janney Montgomery Scott chief investment strategist, told Yahoo Finance. \"We bounced off [the lows] on an intraday basis today. We'll see if it holds or if we need to do a little bit more work on the downside to kind of flush out some of the sentiment that'd gotten perhaps a little bit overly exuberant relative to this advance that we've had earlier this year.\"\n\n\"In the context of the market, we're still up over 8% on a year-to-date basis. The economic conditions fundamentally are still very supportive for stock prices,\" he added. \"We had, once again, a little concern here recently on inflation.

Last week Tesla (TSLA) boss Elon Musk said his business was abandoning plans to accept bitcoin as payment, citing environmental concerns.\n\nRead more: How bad is bitcoin for the environment?\n\nIn a blog post this week, the Ethereum Foundation \u2014 a non-profit that works to maintain the network underpinning the digital asset \u2014 said it would soon shift ethereum to a new infrastructure that would \"end the process of expending a country\u2019s worth of energy on consensus.\"\n\nDevelopers plan to shift ethereum from a \"proof of work\" system to a \"proof of stake\" system.\u00a0\n\nWatch: What are the risks of investing in cryptocurrency?\n\nUnder a proof of work system, computers around the world complete cryptographic maths equations to validate and secure transactions on the network. Solving these equations uses up huge amounts of electricity in the form of computing power. The vast power required stops one individual or group from being able to target the network and overpower it, theoretically allowing an entity to write in transactions sending themselves cryptocurrency.\u00a0\n\nUnder a proof of stake system, participants in the network simply have to prove they hold ethereum to contribute to its underlying operations. Computers \"stake\" their ethereum and in return can validate and secure transactions on the network. A majority of participants in the network must validate transactions for them to go through, which acts as a check against fraud.\n\nCarl Beekhuizen, a developer at the Ethereum Foundation, said in a blog that while there was no \"concrete statistics on energy consumption\" for ethereum, his \"ballpark\" estimates suggested the change in the infrastructure would reduce its energy usage by around 99.95%.\u00a0\n\nRead more: Bitcoin, ethereum and the blockchain technology behind decentralised finance\n\n\"A Proof-of-Stake Ethereum therefore consumes something on the order of 2.62 megawatt,\" Beekhuizen wrote. \"This is not on the scale of countries, provinces, or even cities, but that of a small town (around 2,100 American homes).\n\n\"For reference, Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus on Ethereum currently consumes the energy equivalent of a medium-sized country.\"\n\nAnalysts at Bank of America said in March that ethereum was estimated to be using the same amount of energy each year as Cuba.\n\nBeekhuizen said a proof of stake system would mean energy usage is uncorrelated with price. Under the current system, ethereum's energy usage rises and falls in line with its price.\n\nThe planned transition comes as cryptocurrencies face heightened scrutiny of their environmental impact. Elon Musk was forced to abandon plans for Tesla to accept bitcoin (BTC-USD) as payment, following a backlash linked to the cryptocurrency's environmental impact.\u00a0\n\nBitcoin also uses a proof of work model. Its underlying network uses more energy per year than Ukraine. Analysts at Bank of America said earlier this year that investors had to \"pay attention to the enormous environmental costs of Bitcoin\".\n\nRead more: Tesla's bitcoin investment has carbon footprint of 1.8 million cars\n\nBeekhuizen said ethereum's new infrastructure means each transaction should use the same amount of electricity as \"about 20 minutes of TV.\"\n\n\"By contrast, Ethereum PoW uses the equivalent energy of a house for 2.8 days per transaction and Bitcoin consumes 38 house-days worth,\" he wrote.\n\nThe changes will have major implications for the environmental impact of the broader cryptocurrency space. Ethereum is used as the infrastructure for many other cryptocurrency projects and so-called \"decentralized finance\" applications.\n\nShifting ethereum from proof of work to proof of stake has been planned for years but the plan has been beset by political and technical problems. Beekhuizen said the infrastructure was now up and running and being tested. The foundation hopes to complete the shift in the \"upcoming months\".\n\nBank of America analysts said earlier this year that the shift to proof of stake \"could reduce Ether's carbon footprint\" but warned it would \"increase both the social and governance risks of this crypto-currency.\"\n\nNews of the looming shift came as ethereum and other cryptocurrencies crashed to the lowest point in months. A broad sell-off hit the market on Wednesday, wiping out billions. Ethereum dropped as much as 40% on the day before recovering on Thursday.\n\nWatch: How to prevent getting into debt\n"}, {"headline": "Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies plunge on Elon Musk tweets", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Yahoo Finance UK", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/zIhIwSoKQ4ttQenOA18vrA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/89564dc0-b6e6-11eb-aff5-f9e47e3115fb", "auther": "LaToya Harding", "body": "The price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) crashed to its lowest level since the end of February after Elon Musk sparked concern that Tesla (TSLA) could sell its holdings of the cryptocurrency.\n\nLast night a Twitter account called CryptoWhale tweeted: \u201cBitcoiners are going to slap themselves next quarter when they find out Tesla dumped the rest of their holdings.

However, many made strong recoveries on the day and stocks rallied off the lows. Let\u2019s look at a few top stock trades for Thursday.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nEthereum (CCC:ETH-USD) had been on a powerful rally not that long ago. However, it\u2019s been under pressure since topping out earlier this month and then finally broke down on Wednesday.\n\nAt the session low, Ethereum was down 37% today! However, from the lows, it\u2019s actually up 40%, curbing its one-day losses to \u201cjust\u201d 23% at the moment. The volatility has been wild, to say the least.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNow back above the 50-day and 10-week moving averages, bulls need to see Ethereum hold above these measures. At the very least, it has to hold above $2,550.\n\nIf ETH loses the $2,500 mark, we can\u2019t rule out a return to this week\u2019s low. Luckily, shares caught a bounce right where we had the breakout marked, near $2,000.\n-  7 High Quality Industrial Stocks to Buy Now \n\nOn the upside, however, let\u2019s see how Ethereum does on a test of its 10-day moving average. Above it could put the $3,500 mark and the 21-day moving average in play.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has been range bound since last summer, although $74 continues to hold as support.\n\nOn the upside, we want to see a rally back to $80, where AMD stock will find its 10-week and 50-week moving averages. Above these measures puts the 21-week on the table, followed by resistance at $88.\n\nOn a break below last week\u2019s low at $72.50, it\u2019s possible we see a move lower. In that scenario, keep an eye on the 21-month moving average. If for some reason AMD stock breaks below that measure, the $60 breakout level could be in play.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nWhile other retailers have struggled despite strong earnings results, Target (NYSE:TGT) is doing quite well.\n\nShares are pushing higher on Wednesday, running into its prior highs. From here I\u2019d love to see a push up to the 161.8% extension near $220. Above that puts the two-times range extension at $233 in play.\n-  7 Blue-Chip Stocks Looking Better Than Ever \n\nOn the downside, though, keep an eye on $210. Losing that mark likely puts it below the 10-day and 21-day moving averages, and puts the 10-week and 50-day moving averages on the table. For now, bulls are in control with this one.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nUnlike Target, TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) is not responding well to earnings. However, that\u2019s not the end of the world, either.\n\nShares are trading right down into the 21-week moving average, a measure that has been support all year. If it holds, look to see if TJX stock can reclaim the 10-week.\n\nIf it fails to do so, it\u2019s possible we see a retest of the pre-coronavirus highs near $65, with more support sitting in the low $60s.\n\nBack above $71, and TJX stock could retest the all-time highs.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nJD.com (NASDAQ:JD) was trading really well coming into 2021, but like other growth stocks, it has struggled mightily since topping out in mid-February.\n\nAfter cascading lower, JD stock quickly saw its short-term moving averages turn from support to resistance, while it failed to reclaim $85. This combination should have kept bulls out of the name.\n\nThen it failed to hold the $78 to $79 area and 50-week moving average, which also turned to resistance. Are you sensing a pattern?\n\nNow trying to hold last week\u2019s low near $66.50, let\u2019s navigate this one. On the upside, see how JD stock does on a retest of the $77 to $80 area, if it can get there. There it finds current resistance, but it also finds the 10-day, 10-month and 50-week moving averages.\n\nA close below $66.50 likely puts the 21-month moving average and the $60 area in play.\n\nOn the date of publication, Bret Kenwell held a long position in AMD.

It is now around 45% below record highs reached earlier in the year.

The answer is, for those watching closely, it likely strengthened it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s why: bitcoin proved itself on Wednesday when it saw its second biggest volume day of the year, and market infrastructure did not break. Some exchanges suffered outages, but liquidity was available, as spot volumes show. Moreover, while a drop of over 30% may be dizzying for new buyers high on hopium, such events are not uncommon in bitcoin\u2019s bull-market history.\n\nThe chart above shows bitcoin-dollar volume on the 11 exchanges that are eligible as components of the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX). That means these markets are accessible to U.S. investors, have transparent ownership and do not place limits on bitcoin or dollar withdrawals, among other criteria.\u00a0\n\nRelated: CME Returns to Second Place in Latest Rankings of Bitcoin Futures Exchanges\n\nThe chart shows how the May 19 selloff compared, in bitcoin terms, to volume traded in the Jan. 10 selloff, as Dogecoin and GameStop mania peaked on Jan. 22, and during a second sell-off in February.\n\nThe bitcoin-dollar markets in general are useful to watch, because they can indicate activity at a well-known market entry point \u2013 a place where new entrants \u201cbuying the dip\u201d are likely to place orders.\u00a0\n\nMore narrowly, XBX eligibility means these exchanges can attract institutional activity as well.

Coinbase ETH/USD markets also handled record volume in both ETH and dollar terms on Wednesday, 1.7 million ETH valued in aggregate at $4.5 billion.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe fact that spot market volume can crescendo like this is an indicator of market maturity, at least in these two blue-chip cryptocurrencies: capital is able to flow in as the price drops, and sellers are finding buyers on the way down.\u00a0\n\nMeanwhile, in offshore derivatives markets, all was normal. Wednesday put this week over $4 billion in bitcoin futures liquidations.\u00a0\n\nAs this chart, pulled Thursday from skew.com, shows, this past week was only the third highest week for liquidations so far in 2021, and it\u2019s the fourth time this year that bitcoin futures liquidations have crossed $4 billion in notional value. Offshore futures markets did not artificially flash-crash the price.\u00a0\n\nWednesday\u2019s bitcoin price drop was swifter and deeper than any so far this year. The CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX) low, struck in the wee hours UTC time at $30,037.61, was 54% off its all-time high, 41% off its price before Elon started tweeting and 30% off the prior day\u2019s closing price at midnight UTC.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s the third time this year bitcoin has entered \u201cbear market\u201d territory, by equity markets\u2019 rule of thumb, which is a 20% drop. The two prior occasions occurred as the XBX made its way to its current all-time high ($64,888.19, set on April 14). Some bear market.\n\nOn any time scale, a 30% intra-day drop is unusual for bitcoin. Matt Weller of forex.com presented this illustrative chart Wednesday afternoon on All About Bitcoin on CoinDesk TV.\u00a0\n\nThe chart shows how, in the bull market that began in the second half of 2015, bitcoin saw eight drawdowns of 30% or more. None of them took place in the course of a single 24-hour day. But they all took place during a longer upward trend that took bitcoin\u2019s price from $200 to $20,000.\n\nThe current bull market dates back to March 2020, when bitcoin hit a yearly low of $3,905. If this bull market grows to resemble that period, it will put bitcoin on course to hit the $400,000 mark by July 2022. That\u2019s a big if, but also a popular one.\n- Ray Dalio, Wall Street\u2019s \u2018Oddest Duck,\u2019 Shares the Bitcoin Mind\n- \u2018Grayscale Discount\u2019 Narrows to 10% and Could Shrink More as Lockups Expire\n"}, {"headline": "Stock market news live updates: Stocks log third straight day of losses as technology stocks slide", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Yahoo Finance", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/LOkwytjIRJzVmBpUe__YZQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/df099790-97d8-11eb-bffb-90dd619e59aa", "auther": "Emily McCormick", "body": "Stocks logged a third straight day of declines as inflation concerns persisted.\n\n[Click here to read what's moving markets heading into Thursday, May 20]\n\nThe Nasdaq underperformed, and the index opened lower by more than 1.5% before paring some losses.

However, some strategists said the pullback was to be expected given the strength of the run-up so far this year up until May, and noted it did not reflect a worsening in economic or company fundamentals.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe pullback here has gotten a little deeper over the last couple of trading sessions, not necessarily threatening technically important lines of support,\u201d Mark Luschini, Janney Montgomery Scott chief investment strategist, told Yahoo Finance. \"We bounced off [the lows] on an intraday basis today.

Last week Tesla (TSLA) boss Elon Musk said his business was abandoning plans to accept bitcoin as payment, citing environmental concerns.\n\nRead more: How bad is bitcoin for the environment?\n\nIn a blog post this week, the Ethereum Foundation \u2014 a non-profit that works to maintain the network underpinning the digital asset \u2014 said it would soon shift ethereum to a new infrastructure that would \"end the process of expending a country\u2019s worth of energy on consensus.\"\n\nDevelopers plan to shift ethereum from a \"proof of work\" system to a \"proof of stake\" system.\u00a0\n\nWatch: What are the risks of investing in cryptocurrency?\n\nUnder a proof of work system, computers around the world complete cryptographic maths equations to validate and secure transactions on the network. Solving these equations uses up huge amounts of electricity in the form of computing power. The vast power required stops one individual or group from being able to target the network and overpower it, theoretically allowing an entity to write in transactions sending themselves cryptocurrency.\u00a0\n\nUnder a proof of stake system, participants in the network simply have to prove they hold ethereum to contribute to its underlying operations. Computers \"stake\" their ethereum and in return can validate and secure transactions on the network. A majority of participants in the network must validate transactions for them to go through, which acts as a check against fraud.\n\nCarl Beekhuizen, a developer at the Ethereum Foundation, said in a blog that while there was no \"concrete statistics on energy consumption\" for ethereum, his \"ballpark\" estimates suggested the change in the infrastructure would reduce its energy usage by around 99.95%.\u00a0\n\nRead more: Bitcoin, ethereum and the blockchain technology behind decentralised finance\n\n\"A Proof-of-Stake Ethereum therefore consumes something on the order of 2.62 megawatt,\" Beekhuizen wrote. \"This is not on the scale of countries, provinces, or even cities, but that of a small town (around 2,100 American homes).\n\n\"For reference, Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus on Ethereum currently consumes the energy equivalent of a medium-sized country.\"\n\nAnalysts at Bank of America said in March that ethereum was estimated to be using the same amount of energy each year as Cuba.\n\nBeekhuizen said a proof of stake system would mean energy usage is uncorrelated with price. Under the current system, ethereum's energy usage rises and falls in line with its price.\n\nThe planned transition comes as cryptocurrencies face heightened scrutiny of their environmental impact. Elon Musk was forced to abandon plans for Tesla to accept bitcoin (BTC-USD) as payment, following a backlash linked to the cryptocurrency's environmental impact.\u00a0\n\nBitcoin also uses a proof of work model. Its underlying network uses more energy per year than Ukraine. Analysts at Bank of America said earlier this year that investors had to \"pay attention to the enormous environmental costs of Bitcoin\".\n\nRead more: Tesla's bitcoin investment has carbon footprint of 1.8 million cars\n\nBeekhuizen said ethereum's new infrastructure means each transaction should use the same amount of electricity as \"about 20 minutes of TV.\"\n\n\"By contrast, Ethereum PoW uses the equivalent energy of a house for 2.8 days per transaction and Bitcoin consumes 38 house-days worth,\" he wrote.\n\nThe changes will have major implications for the environmental impact of the broader cryptocurrency space. Ethereum is used as the infrastructure for many other cryptocurrency projects and so-called \"decentralized finance\" applications.\n\nShifting ethereum from proof of work to proof of stake has been planned for years but the plan has been beset by political and technical problems. Beekhuizen said the infrastructure was now up and running and being tested. The foundation hopes to complete the shift in the \"upcoming months\".\n\nBank of America analysts said earlier this year that the shift to proof of stake \"could reduce Ether's carbon footprint\" but warned it would \"increase both the social and governance risks of this crypto-currency.\"\n\nNews of the looming shift came as ethereum and other cryptocurrencies crashed to the lowest point in months. A broad sell-off hit the market on Wednesday, wiping out billions. Ethereum dropped as much as 40% on the day before recovering on Thursday.\n\nWatch: How to prevent getting into debt\n"}, {"headline": "Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies plunge on Elon Musk tweets", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Yahoo Finance UK", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/zIhIwSoKQ4ttQenOA18vrA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/89564dc0-b6e6-11eb-aff5-f9e47e3115fb", "auther": "LaToya Harding", "body": "The price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) crashed to its lowest level since the end of February after Elon Musk sparked concern that Tesla (TSLA) could sell its holdings of the cryptocurrency.\n\nLast night a Twitter account called CryptoWhale tweeted: \u201cBitcoiners are going to slap themselves next quarter when they find out Tesla dumped the rest of their holdings.

However, many made strong recoveries on the day and stocks rallied off the lows. Let\u2019s look at a few top stock trades for Thursday.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nEthereum (CCC:ETH-USD) had been on a powerful rally not that long ago. However, it\u2019s been under pressure since topping out earlier this month and then finally broke down on Wednesday.\n\nAt the session low, Ethereum was down 37% today! However, from the lows, it\u2019s actually up 40%, curbing its one-day losses to \u201cjust\u201d 23% at the moment. The volatility has been wild, to say the least.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNow back above the 50-day and 10-week moving averages, bulls need to see Ethereum hold above these measures. At the very least, it has to hold above $2,550.\n\nIf ETH loses the $2,500 mark, we can\u2019t rule out a return to this week\u2019s low. Luckily, shares caught a bounce right where we had the breakout marked, near $2,000.\n-  7 High Quality Industrial Stocks to Buy Now \n\nOn the upside, however, let\u2019s see how Ethereum does on a test of its 10-day moving average. Above it could put the $3,500 mark and the 21-day moving average in play.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has been range bound since last summer, although $74 continues to hold as support.\n\nOn the upside, we want to see a rally back to $80, where AMD stock will find its 10-week and 50-week moving averages. Above these measures puts the 21-week on the table, followed by resistance at $88.\n\nOn a break below last week\u2019s low at $72.50, it\u2019s possible we see a move lower. In that scenario, keep an eye on the 21-month moving average. If for some reason AMD stock breaks below that measure, the $60 breakout level could be in play.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nWhile other retailers have struggled despite strong earnings results, Target (NYSE:TGT) is doing quite well.\n\nShares are pushing higher on Wednesday, running into its prior highs. From here I\u2019d love to see a push up to the 161.8% extension near $220. Above that puts the two-times range extension at $233 in play.\n-  7 Blue-Chip Stocks Looking Better Than Ever \n\nOn the downside, though, keep an eye on $210. Losing that mark likely puts it below the 10-day and 21-day moving averages, and puts the 10-week and 50-day moving averages on the table. For now, bulls are in control with this one.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nUnlike Target, TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) is not responding well to earnings. However, that\u2019s not the end of the world, either.\n\nShares are trading right down into the 21-week moving average, a measure that has been support all year. If it holds, look to see if TJX stock can reclaim the 10-week.\n\nIf it fails to do so, it\u2019s possible we see a retest of the pre-coronavirus highs near $65, with more support sitting in the low $60s.\n\nBack above $71, and TJX stock could retest the all-time highs.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nJD.com (NASDAQ:JD) was trading really well coming into 2021, but like other growth stocks, it has struggled mightily since topping out in mid-February.\n\nAfter cascading lower, JD stock quickly saw its short-term moving averages turn from support to resistance, while it failed to reclaim $85. This combination should have kept bulls out of the name.\n\nThen it failed to hold the $78 to $79 area and 50-week moving average, which also turned to resistance. Are you sensing a pattern?\n\nNow trying to hold last week\u2019s low near $66.50, let\u2019s navigate this one. On the upside, see how JD stock does on a retest of the $77 to $80 area, if it can get there. There it finds current resistance, but it also finds the 10-day, 10-month and 50-week moving averages.\n\nA close below $66.50 likely puts the 21-month moving average and the $60 area in play.\n\nOn the date of publication, Bret Kenwell held a long position in AMD.

The city currently has an \"opt in\" approach under which exchanges can apply to be licensed by the Securities and Futures Commission, but this is not compulsory.\u00a0\n\nThe city's Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) said on Friday that all virtual asset (VA) exchanges should be licensed if they wished to operate in Hong Kong.\n\nIt also added \"confining the services of a VA exchange to professional investors... is appropriate at least for the initial stage of the licensing regime.\"\n\nCryptocurrencies have been struggling to regain losses from a massive sell-off earlier in the week, which saw the crypto world lose 20% of its value as deep correction hit the market. Bitcoin fell below $32,000 on Wednesday, while ethereum dropped as much as 30%.\n\n\"Crypto holders who are hoping for a rapid bounce back from this week\u2019s dramatic falls, should buckle up and expect another rollercoaster ride, Streeter added. \"Sentiment has shifted not simply because powerful influencers like Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk have stepped back from being cheerleaders for bitcoin.\"\n"}, {"headline": "Market Wrap: China Breaks Crypto as Bitcoin Falls to $36K, ETH Drops $300 in Two Hours", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "CoinDesk via Yahoo Finance", "date": "20 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/VxMmaWmxKiuDQwHcD9RlDQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/coindesk_75/81fd17c16d722db0dd9507be3a8c02f3", "auther": "Daniel Cawrey", "body": "It has been a low-volume Friday to cap an up-and-down week for cryptocurrencies.

A put is a right but not an obligation to sell an asset while a call is the right but not an obligation to buy an asset \u2013 both within a specific time frame, known as expiration.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s an intriguing development because bitcoin has not been at the $50,000 price level in over a week and it\u2019s possibly a sign smart options traders are taking both sides of the trade at that level.\n\n\u201cThe open interest doesn\u2019t indicate directionality,\u201d noted Vishal Shah, founder of crypto derivatives exchange Alpha5.\n\nSince the beginning of April, 30-day volatility for 10 brand-name crypto assets on the CoinDesk 20 have all climbed, including bitcoin. However, it is ethereum classic (ETC) and ether that are in the stratosphere of wild price gyrations. Both assets have over 30-day volatility at 250% as of closing data from Thursday.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe part that stands out the most is that volatility has exploded recently, with many assets experiencing over 200% realized, which is huge,\u201d said Rich Rosenblum, president of crypto market maker GSR. \u201cThen, at the same time, BTC volatility is elevated vs. its lull a few weeks ago, but certainly muted relative to the rest, staying at under 100%.\u201d\n\nGreg Magadini, chief executive officer, Genesis Volatility, noted that ETH\u2019s \u201cDVOL\u201d metric, which is a volatility measure similar to traditional markets\u2019 VIX and tracked by options exchange Deribit, is up to 180. It\u2019s record high was Thursday, at 190. He says realized volatility, which is derived from analyzing historical returns, is now priced into the market.\u00a0\n\n\u201cAlthough we\u2019ve come down from peak realized volatility seen in the past few days, over +300%, volatility is known to cluster,\u201d said Magadini. \u201cThe options markets are pricing in over +100% implied volatility for all expirations and about 150% for near-dated options.\u201d\n\nEther, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was trading around $2,363 as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET), slipping 15.5% over the prior 24 hours. The asset is below the 10-hour moving average as well as the 50-day, a bearish signal for market technicians.\u00a0\n\nEther dumped from $2,740 around 14:15 UTC (10:15 a.m. ET) to $2,426 by 16:15 UTC (12:15 p.m. ET), a $314 decrease based on CoinDesk 20 data. ETH is still slipping, at $2,363 as of press time.\u00a0\n\nNick Mancini, research analyst at crypto sentiment analytics platform Trade the Chain, says major blockchain assets like bitcoin and ether are still seen positively, despite recent price dumps and volatility jumps.\u00a0\n\n\u201cGoing forward, long-term sentiment scores for most crypto, especially bitcoin and ether, are still high, in the 70s, despite all of the recent turmoil,\u201d Mancini. \u201cwhich means the bullish thesis remains intact.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe bullish thesis may be holding overall, but traders have clearly been losing some interest in ether versus other cryptocurrencies. Ether\u2019s dominance, its share of the greater cryptocurrency market, has started to drop. After hitting a 2021 high of 20.61% May 15, ETH dominance has started to falter, below 18% share and down 2% the past 24 hours as of press time.\n\nRead More: US Seeks Information About $1.4M EtherDelta Hack in 2017\n\nDigital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are all red Friday.

It touched a low of $31,663.46 before recovering to trade just above $37,000. That level still marked a fall of 15% on the day.\n\nBitcoin's slump hit confidence in the broader market.

The central bank issued a statement on its WeChat account reiterating that financial institutions should not accept or deal with cryptocurrencies, the Financial Times reported.\n\n\"China has for some time been putting pressure on the crypto space, but this marks an intensification,\" said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com. \"Other countries might follow now as central banks make strides towards their own digital currencies.\"\n\nWatch: What is bitcoin?\n\nWednesday's slump extended a slide that began last week after Tesla (TSLA) boss Elon Musk announced his company would no longer pursue plans to accept bitcoin as payment for its electrical cars. Musk \u2014 a long-time crypto advocate \u2014 cited environmental concerns. Dogecoin (DOGE-USD), a Musk favourite, was down 21% on Wednesday to $0.37.\n\nMusk signalled some support for bitcoin as selling gripped the market.

It is now around 45% below record highs reached earlier in the year. The cryptocurrency remains up 15% since the start of the year, following a spectacular rally that began last October.\n\nBitcoin's run-up was initially fuelled by the embrace of mainstream institutions. Banks, payment companies like Square (SQ) and PayPal (PYPL), and tech businesses such as Tesla or MicroStrategy (MSTR) all announced they were either working with or investing in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. MicroStrategy has put over $2bn into bitcoin and this week invested another $10m into buying into the price dip. Shares in the company slumped 11% at the open in New York.\n\nRead more: How bad is bitcoin for the environment?\n\nMore recently, crypto gains have been fuelled by retail investors piling into the market to take advantage of price momentum.

The answer is, for those watching closely, it likely strengthened it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s why: bitcoin proved itself on Wednesday when it saw its second biggest volume day of the year, and market infrastructure did not break. Some exchanges suffered outages, but liquidity was available, as spot volumes show. Moreover, while a drop of over 30% may be dizzying for new buyers high on hopium, such events are not uncommon in bitcoin\u2019s bull-market history.\n\nThe chart above shows bitcoin-dollar volume on the 11 exchanges that are eligible as components of the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX). That means these markets are accessible to U.S. investors, have transparent ownership and do not place limits on bitcoin or dollar withdrawals, among other criteria.\u00a0\n\nRelated: CME Returns to Second Place in Latest Rankings of Bitcoin Futures Exchanges\n\nThe chart shows how the May 19 selloff compared, in bitcoin terms, to volume traded in the Jan. 10 selloff, as Dogecoin and GameStop mania peaked on Jan. 22, and during a second sell-off in February.\n\nThe bitcoin-dollar markets in general are useful to watch, because they can indicate activity at a well-known market entry point \u2013 a place where new entrants \u201cbuying the dip\u201d are likely to place orders.\u00a0\n\nMore narrowly, XBX eligibility means these exchanges can attract institutional activity as well. In particular, LMAX Digital serves institutional clients exclusively, and Coinbase (marked here as Coinbase Pro) volume is 64% institutional, according to the company\u2019s latest earnings report.\n\n(To get insights like this in your inbox every Monday,\u00a0sign up for CoinDesk Indexes\u2019 weekly newsletter, \u201cThe Hard Fork\u201d.)\n\nRelated: Market Wrap: China Breaks Crypto as Bitcoin Falls to $36K, ETH Drops $300 in Two Hours\n\nCoinbase specifically set records on Wednesday, handling over $4 billion in notional BTC/USD volume for the first time. (It was not a record in bitcoin units. That record was set Dec. 13 2015, when 165,543 BTC changed hands on Coinbase dollar markets. For context, December 2015 saw bitcoin trading up into the $400s, four months into a bull market that would last through December 2017.) Coinbase ETH/USD markets also handled record volume in both ETH and dollar terms on Wednesday, 1.7 million ETH valued in aggregate at $4.5 billion.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe fact that spot market volume can crescendo like this is an indicator of market maturity, at least in these two blue-chip cryptocurrencies: capital is able to flow in as the price drops, and sellers are finding buyers on the way down.\u00a0\n\nMeanwhile, in offshore derivatives markets, all was normal. Wednesday put this week over $4 billion in bitcoin futures liquidations.\u00a0\n\nAs this chart, pulled Thursday from skew.com, shows, this past week was only the third highest week for liquidations so far in 2021, and it\u2019s the fourth time this year that bitcoin futures liquidations have crossed $4 billion in notional value. Offshore futures markets did not artificially flash-crash the price.\u00a0\n\nWednesday\u2019s bitcoin price drop was swifter and deeper than any so far this year. The CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX) low, struck in the wee hours UTC time at $30,037.61, was 54% off its all-time high, 41% off its price before Elon started tweeting and 30% off the prior day\u2019s closing price at midnight UTC.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s the third time this year bitcoin has entered \u201cbear market\u201d territory, by equity markets\u2019 rule of thumb, which is a 20% drop. The two prior occasions occurred as the XBX made its way to its current all-time high ($64,888.19, set on April 14). Some bear market.\n\nOn any time scale, a 30% intra-day drop is unusual for bitcoin. Matt Weller of forex.com presented this illustrative chart Wednesday afternoon on All About Bitcoin on CoinDesk TV.\u00a0\n\nThe chart shows how, in the bull market that began in the second half of 2015, bitcoin saw eight drawdowns of 30% or more. None of them took place in the course of a single 24-hour day. But they all took place during a longer upward trend that took bitcoin\u2019s price from $200 to $20,000.\n\nThe current bull market dates back to March 2020, when bitcoin hit a yearly low of $3,905. If this bull market grows to resemble that period, it will put bitcoin on course to hit the $400,000 mark by July 2022. That\u2019s a big if, but also a popular one.\n- Ray Dalio, Wall Street\u2019s \u2018Oddest Duck,\u2019 Shares the Bitcoin Mind\n- \u2018Grayscale Discount\u2019 Narrows to 10% and Could Shrink More as Lockups Expire\n"}, {"headline": "Stock market news live updates: Stocks log third straight day of losses as technology stocks slide", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Yahoo Finance", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/LOkwytjIRJzVmBpUe__YZQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/df099790-97d8-11eb-bffb-90dd619e59aa", "auther": "Emily McCormick", "body": "Stocks logged a third straight day of declines as inflation concerns persisted.\n\n[Click here to read what's moving markets heading into Thursday, May 20]\n\nThe Nasdaq underperformed, and the index opened lower by more than 1.5% before paring some losses.

However, the minutes covered the Federal Open Market Committee's meeting from before the release of the much weaker-than-expected April jobs report and government print showing a much greater-than-expected increase in consumer prices, rendering them somewhat outdated.\u00a0\n\n\u2014\n\nHere were the main moves in markets as of 4:03 p.m. ET:\n- S&P 500 (^GSPC): -12.04 (-0.29%) to 4,115.79\n- Dow (^DJI): -163.17 (-0.48%) to 33,897.49\n- Nasdaq (^IXIC): -3.90 (-0.03%) to 13,299.74\n- Crude (CL=F): -$2.17 (-3.31%) to $63.32 a barrel\n- Gold (GC=F): +$3.60 (+0.19%) to $1,871.60 per ounce\n- 10-year Treasury (^TNX): +4.1 bps to yield 1.6830%\n\n\u2014\n\nThe Federal Reserve's April meeting minutes Wednesday afternoon reinforced that most Federal Open Market Committee members did not think QE tapering or rate increases were needed in the near-term, given the distance the economy still needs to make up to reach the Fed's employment and price stability goals.\u00a0\n\n\"Participants observed that economic activity had picked up sharply this year, with robust gains in consumer spending, housing-sector activity, business equipment investment, and manufacturing production,\" according to the minutes. \"They noted that the acceleration in economic activity reflected positive developments associated with the rapid pace of vaccinations as well as continued support from fiscal and monetary policies. Nevertheless, participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee\u2019s maximum-employment and price-stability goals.\"\u00a0\n\n\u2014\n\nWednesday's stock drop put the three major indexes on pace for a third straight day of losses, as well as their fifth down day over the past seven sessions. However, some strategists said the pullback was to be expected given the strength of the run-up so far this year up until May, and noted it did not reflect a worsening in economic or company fundamentals.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe pullback here has gotten a little deeper over the last couple of trading sessions, not necessarily threatening technically important lines of support,\u201d Mark Luschini, Janney Montgomery Scott chief investment strategist, told Yahoo Finance. \"We bounced off [the lows] on an intraday basis today. We'll see if it holds or if we need to do a little bit more work on the downside to kind of flush out some of the sentiment that'd gotten perhaps a little bit overly exuberant relative to this advance that we've had earlier this year.\"\n\n\"In the context of the market, we're still up over 8% on a year-to-date basis. The economic conditions fundamentally are still very supportive for stock prices,\" he added. \"We had, once again, a little concern here recently on inflation.

Last week Tesla (TSLA) boss Elon Musk said his business was abandoning plans to accept bitcoin as payment, citing environmental concerns.\n\nRead more: How bad is bitcoin for the environment?\n\nIn a blog post this week, the Ethereum Foundation \u2014 a non-profit that works to maintain the network underpinning the digital asset \u2014 said it would soon shift ethereum to a new infrastructure that would \"end the process of expending a country\u2019s worth of energy on consensus.\"\n\nDevelopers plan to shift ethereum from a \"proof of work\" system to a \"proof of stake\" system.\u00a0\n\nWatch: What are the risks of investing in cryptocurrency?\n\nUnder a proof of work system, computers around the world complete cryptographic maths equations to validate and secure transactions on the network. Solving these equations uses up huge amounts of electricity in the form of computing power. The vast power required stops one individual or group from being able to target the network and overpower it, theoretically allowing an entity to write in transactions sending themselves cryptocurrency.\u00a0\n\nUnder a proof of stake system, participants in the network simply have to prove they hold ethereum to contribute to its underlying operations. Computers \"stake\" their ethereum and in return can validate and secure transactions on the network. A majority of participants in the network must validate transactions for them to go through, which acts as a check against fraud.\n\nCarl Beekhuizen, a developer at the Ethereum Foundation, said in a blog that while there was no \"concrete statistics on energy consumption\" for ethereum, his \"ballpark\" estimates suggested the change in the infrastructure would reduce its energy usage by around 99.95%.\u00a0\n\nRead more: Bitcoin, ethereum and the blockchain technology behind decentralised finance\n\n\"A Proof-of-Stake Ethereum therefore consumes something on the order of 2.62 megawatt,\" Beekhuizen wrote. \"This is not on the scale of countries, provinces, or even cities, but that of a small town (around 2,100 American homes).\n\n\"For reference, Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus on Ethereum currently consumes the energy equivalent of a medium-sized country.\"\n\nAnalysts at Bank of America said in March that ethereum was estimated to be using the same amount of energy each year as Cuba.\n\nBeekhuizen said a proof of stake system would mean energy usage is uncorrelated with price. Under the current system, ethereum's energy usage rises and falls in line with its price.\n\nThe planned transition comes as cryptocurrencies face heightened scrutiny of their environmental impact. Elon Musk was forced to abandon plans for Tesla to accept bitcoin (BTC-USD) as payment, following a backlash linked to the cryptocurrency's environmental impact.\u00a0\n\nBitcoin also uses a proof of work model. Its underlying network uses more energy per year than Ukraine. Analysts at Bank of America said earlier this year that investors had to \"pay attention to the enormous environmental costs of Bitcoin\".\n\nRead more: Tesla's bitcoin investment has carbon footprint of 1.8 million cars\n\nBeekhuizen said ethereum's new infrastructure means each transaction should use the same amount of electricity as \"about 20 minutes of TV.\"\n\n\"By contrast, Ethereum PoW uses the equivalent energy of a house for 2.8 days per transaction and Bitcoin consumes 38 house-days worth,\" he wrote.\n\nThe changes will have major implications for the environmental impact of the broader cryptocurrency space. Ethereum is used as the infrastructure for many other cryptocurrency projects and so-called \"decentralized finance\" applications.\n\nShifting ethereum from proof of work to proof of stake has been planned for years but the plan has been beset by political and technical problems. Beekhuizen said the infrastructure was now up and running and being tested. The foundation hopes to complete the shift in the \"upcoming months\".\n\nBank of America analysts said earlier this year that the shift to proof of stake \"could reduce Ether's carbon footprint\" but warned it would \"increase both the social and governance risks of this crypto-currency.\"\n\nNews of the looming shift came as ethereum and other cryptocurrencies crashed to the lowest point in months. A broad sell-off hit the market on Wednesday, wiping out billions. Ethereum dropped as much as 40% on the day before recovering on Thursday.\n\nWatch: How to prevent getting into debt\n"}, {"headline": "Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies plunge on Elon Musk tweets", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Yahoo Finance UK", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/zIhIwSoKQ4ttQenOA18vrA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/89564dc0-b6e6-11eb-aff5-f9e47e3115fb", "auther": "LaToya Harding", "body": "The price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) crashed to its lowest level since the end of February after Elon Musk sparked concern that Tesla (TSLA) could sell its holdings of the cryptocurrency.\n\nLast night a Twitter account called CryptoWhale tweeted: \u201cBitcoiners are going to slap themselves next quarter when they find out Tesla dumped the rest of their holdings.

However, many made strong recoveries on the day and stocks rallied off the lows. Let\u2019s look at a few top stock trades for Thursday.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nEthereum (CCC:ETH-USD) had been on a powerful rally not that long ago. However, it\u2019s been under pressure since topping out earlier this month and then finally broke down on Wednesday.\n\nAt the session low, Ethereum was down 37% today! However, from the lows, it\u2019s actually up 40%, curbing its one-day losses to \u201cjust\u201d 23% at the moment. The volatility has been wild, to say the least.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNow back above the 50-day and 10-week moving averages, bulls need to see Ethereum hold above these measures. At the very least, it has to hold above $2,550.\n\nIf ETH loses the $2,500 mark, we can\u2019t rule out a return to this week\u2019s low. Luckily, shares caught a bounce right where we had the breakout marked, near $2,000.\n-  7 High Quality Industrial Stocks to Buy Now \n\nOn the upside, however, let\u2019s see how Ethereum does on a test of its 10-day moving average. Above it could put the $3,500 mark and the 21-day moving average in play.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has been range bound since last summer, although $74 continues to hold as support.\n\nOn the upside, we want to see a rally back to $80, where AMD stock will find its 10-week and 50-week moving averages. Above these measures puts the 21-week on the table, followed by resistance at $88.\n\nOn a break below last week\u2019s low at $72.50, it\u2019s possible we see a move lower. In that scenario, keep an eye on the 21-month moving average. If for some reason AMD stock breaks below that measure, the $60 breakout level could be in play.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nWhile other retailers have struggled despite strong earnings results, Target (NYSE:TGT) is doing quite well.\n\nShares are pushing higher on Wednesday, running into its prior highs. From here I\u2019d love to see a push up to the 161.8% extension near $220. Above that puts the two-times range extension at $233 in play.\n-  7 Blue-Chip Stocks Looking Better Than Ever \n\nOn the downside, though, keep an eye on $210. Losing that mark likely puts it below the 10-day and 21-day moving averages, and puts the 10-week and 50-day moving averages on the table. For now, bulls are in control with this one.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nUnlike Target, TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) is not responding well to earnings. However, that\u2019s not the end of the world, either.\n\nShares are trading right down into the 21-week moving average, a measure that has been support all year. If it holds, look to see if TJX stock can reclaim the 10-week.\n\nIf it fails to do so, it\u2019s possible we see a retest of the pre-coronavirus highs near $65, with more support sitting in the low $60s.\n\nBack above $71, and TJX stock could retest the all-time highs.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nJD.com (NASDAQ:JD) was trading really well coming into 2021, but like other growth stocks, it has struggled mightily since topping out in mid-February.\n\nAfter cascading lower, JD stock quickly saw its short-term moving averages turn from support to resistance, while it failed to reclaim $85. This combination should have kept bulls out of the name.\n\nThen it failed to hold the $78 to $79 area and 50-week moving average, which also turned to resistance. Are you sensing a pattern?\n\nNow trying to hold last week\u2019s low near $66.50, let\u2019s navigate this one. On the upside, see how JD stock does on a retest of the $77 to $80 area, if it can get there. There it finds current resistance, but it also finds the 10-day, 10-month and 50-week moving averages.\n\nA close below $66.50 likely puts the 21-month moving average and the $60 area in play.\n\nOn the date of publication, Bret Kenwell held a long position in AMD.

Both assets have over 30-day volatility at 250% as of closing data from Thursday.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe part that stands out the most is that volatility has exploded recently, with many assets experiencing over 200% realized, which is huge,\u201d said Rich Rosenblum, president of crypto market maker GSR. \u201cThen, at the same time, BTC volatility is elevated vs. its lull a few weeks ago, but certainly muted relative to the rest, staying at under 100%.\u201d\n\nGreg Magadini, chief executive officer, Genesis Volatility, noted that ETH\u2019s \u201cDVOL\u201d metric, which is a volatility measure similar to traditional markets\u2019 VIX and tracked by options exchange Deribit, is up to 180.

Musk \u2014 a long-time crypto advocate \u2014 cited environmental concerns. Dogecoin (DOGE-USD), a Musk favourite, was down 21% on Wednesday to $0.37.\n\nMusk signalled some support for bitcoin as selling gripped the market.

It is now around 45% below record highs reached earlier in the year. The cryptocurrency remains up 15% since the start of the year, following a spectacular rally that began last October.\n\nBitcoin's run-up was initially fuelled by the embrace of mainstream institutions. Banks, payment companies like Square (SQ) and PayPal (PYPL), and tech businesses such as Tesla or MicroStrategy (MSTR) all announced they were either working with or investing in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.

The stock has shed more than one-fifth of its value the past week alone, coinciding with a plunge in cryptocurrency prices.\n\nCryptocurrencies extended losses on Wednesday, with bitcoin prices trading lower by more than 18% to trade below $36,000. This marked the lowest level since early February, and sent prices below their closely watched 200-day moving average. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, slid more than 24% to trade below $2,500, just a week after reaching an all-time high of over $4,300.\u00a0\n\nThe slide in prices for digital tokens over the past week followed an announcement from Tesla CEO Elon Musk that the electric car maker would no longer be accepting bitcoin as payment for vehicles, with the announcement coming just three months after the company first said it would accept the digital tokens. On Wednesday, the moves lower in crypto prices were exacerbated after the People's Bank of China doubled down on its stance that cryptocurrencies could not be used for payments.\n\n\u2014\n\nEmily McCormick is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The answer is, for those watching closely, it likely strengthened it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s why: bitcoin proved itself on Wednesday when it saw its second biggest volume day of the year, and market infrastructure did not break. Some exchanges suffered outages, but liquidity was available, as spot volumes show. Moreover, while a drop of over 30% may be dizzying for new buyers high on hopium, such events are not uncommon in bitcoin\u2019s bull-market history.\n\nThe chart above shows bitcoin-dollar volume on the 11 exchanges that are eligible as components of the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX). That means these markets are accessible to U.S. investors, have transparent ownership and do not place limits on bitcoin or dollar withdrawals, among other criteria.\u00a0\n\nRelated: CME Returns to Second Place in Latest Rankings of Bitcoin Futures Exchanges\n\nThe chart shows how the May 19 selloff compared, in bitcoin terms, to volume traded in the Jan. 10 selloff, as Dogecoin and GameStop mania peaked on Jan. 22, and during a second sell-off in February.\n\nThe bitcoin-dollar markets in general are useful to watch, because they can indicate activity at a well-known market entry point \u2013 a place where new entrants \u201cbuying the dip\u201d are likely to place orders.\u00a0\n\nMore narrowly, XBX eligibility means these exchanges can attract institutional activity as well. In particular, LMAX Digital serves institutional clients exclusively, and Coinbase (marked here as Coinbase Pro) volume is 64% institutional, according to the company\u2019s latest earnings report.\n\n(To get insights like this in your inbox every Monday,\u00a0sign up for CoinDesk Indexes\u2019 weekly newsletter, \u201cThe Hard Fork\u201d.)\n\nRelated: Market Wrap: China Breaks Crypto as Bitcoin Falls to $36K, ETH Drops $300 in Two Hours\n\nCoinbase specifically set records on Wednesday, handling over $4 billion in notional BTC/USD volume for the first time. (It was not a record in bitcoin units. That record was set Dec. 13 2015, when 165,543 BTC changed hands on Coinbase dollar markets. For context, December 2015 saw bitcoin trading up into the $400s, four months into a bull market that would last through December 2017.) Coinbase ETH/USD markets also handled record volume in both ETH and dollar terms on Wednesday, 1.7 million ETH valued in aggregate at $4.5 billion.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe fact that spot market volume can crescendo like this is an indicator of market maturity, at least in these two blue-chip cryptocurrencies: capital is able to flow in as the price drops, and sellers are finding buyers on the way down.\u00a0\n\nMeanwhile, in offshore derivatives markets, all was normal. Wednesday put this week over $4 billion in bitcoin futures liquidations.\u00a0\n\nAs this chart, pulled Thursday from skew.com, shows, this past week was only the third highest week for liquidations so far in 2021, and it\u2019s the fourth time this year that bitcoin futures liquidations have crossed $4 billion in notional value. Offshore futures markets did not artificially flash-crash the price.\u00a0\n\nWednesday\u2019s bitcoin price drop was swifter and deeper than any so far this year. The CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX) low, struck in the wee hours UTC time at $30,037.61, was 54% off its all-time high, 41% off its price before Elon started tweeting and 30% off the prior day\u2019s closing price at midnight UTC.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s the third time this year bitcoin has entered \u201cbear market\u201d territory, by equity markets\u2019 rule of thumb, which is a 20% drop. The two prior occasions occurred as the XBX made its way to its current all-time high ($64,888.19, set on April 14). Some bear market.\n\nOn any time scale, a 30% intra-day drop is unusual for bitcoin. Matt Weller of forex.com presented this illustrative chart Wednesday afternoon on All About Bitcoin on CoinDesk TV.\u00a0\n\nThe chart shows how, in the bull market that began in the second half of 2015, bitcoin saw eight drawdowns of 30% or more. None of them took place in the course of a single 24-hour day. But they all took place during a longer upward trend that took bitcoin\u2019s price from $200 to $20,000.\n\nThe current bull market dates back to March 2020, when bitcoin hit a yearly low of $3,905. If this bull market grows to resemble that period, it will put bitcoin on course to hit the $400,000 mark by July 2022. That\u2019s a big if, but also a popular one.\n- Ray Dalio, Wall Street\u2019s \u2018Oddest Duck,\u2019 Shares the Bitcoin Mind\n- \u2018Grayscale Discount\u2019 Narrows to 10% and Could Shrink More as Lockups Expire\n"}, {"headline": "Stock market news live updates: Stocks log third straight day of losses as technology stocks slide", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Yahoo Finance", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/LOkwytjIRJzVmBpUe__YZQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/df099790-97d8-11eb-bffb-90dd619e59aa", "auther": "Emily McCormick", "body": "Stocks logged a third straight day of declines as inflation concerns persisted.\n\n[Click here to read what's moving markets heading into Thursday, May 20]\n\nThe Nasdaq underperformed, and the index opened lower by more than 1.5% before paring some losses.

Cryptocurrencies sold off, with bitcoin (BTC-USD) sinking more than 17% to trade below $38,000, or the lowest level since February, and ethereum (ETH-USD) plunging 21% to below $3,800. The moves lower extended a recent bout of volatility and were exacerbated after the People's Bank of China doubled down on its stance that cryptocurrencies could not be used for payments. \n\nLeadership in equity markets has see-sawed between cyclical and value stocks and technology shares, as investors consider prospects for a strong economic rebound, but also the possibility that the pick-up in activity generates a surge in inflation that ultimately weighs on the recovery.

The economy is starting to accelerate as we reopen. So there's a lot of reasons to continue owning equities, and it's all about having a game plan.\"\u00a0\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal Reserve released its April meeting minutes Wednesday afternoon, showing that \"participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee\u2019s maximum-employment and price-stability goals,\" and suggesting that they did not believe a near-term adjustment to monetary policy was not imminent. However, the minutes covered the Federal Open Market Committee's meeting from before the release of the much weaker-than-expected April jobs report and government print showing a much greater-than-expected increase in consumer prices, rendering them somewhat outdated.\u00a0\n\n\u2014\n\nHere were the main moves in markets as of 4:03 p.m. ET:\n- S&P 500 (^GSPC): -12.04 (-0.29%) to 4,115.79\n- Dow (^DJI): -163.17 (-0.48%) to 33,897.49\n- Nasdaq (^IXIC): -3.90 (-0.03%) to 13,299.74\n- Crude (CL=F): -$2.17 (-3.31%) to $63.32 a barrel\n- Gold (GC=F): +$3.60 (+0.19%) to $1,871.60 per ounce\n- 10-year Treasury (^TNX): +4.1 bps to yield 1.6830%\n\n\u2014\n\nThe Federal Reserve's April meeting minutes Wednesday afternoon reinforced that most Federal Open Market Committee members did not think QE tapering or rate increases were needed in the near-term, given the distance the economy still needs to make up to reach the Fed's employment and price stability goals.\u00a0\n\n\"Participants observed that economic activity had picked up sharply this year, with robust gains in consumer spending, housing-sector activity, business equipment investment, and manufacturing production,\" according to the minutes. \"They noted that the acceleration in economic activity reflected positive developments associated with the rapid pace of vaccinations as well as continued support from fiscal and monetary policies. Nevertheless, participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee\u2019s maximum-employment and price-stability goals.\"\u00a0\n\n\u2014\n\nWednesday's stock drop put the three major indexes on pace for a third straight day of losses, as well as their fifth down day over the past seven sessions. However, some strategists said the pullback was to be expected given the strength of the run-up so far this year up until May, and noted it did not reflect a worsening in economic or company fundamentals.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe pullback here has gotten a little deeper over the last couple of trading sessions, not necessarily threatening technically important lines of support,\u201d Mark Luschini, Janney Montgomery Scott chief investment strategist, told Yahoo Finance. \"We bounced off [the lows] on an intraday basis today. We'll see if it holds or if we need to do a little bit more work on the downside to kind of flush out some of the sentiment that'd gotten perhaps a little bit overly exuberant relative to this advance that we've had earlier this year.\"\n\n\"In the context of the market, we're still up over 8% on a year-to-date basis. The economic conditions fundamentally are still very supportive for stock prices,\" he added. \"We had, once again, a little concern here recently on inflation. Obviously the big risk at the moment is that it's not so transitory in nature and that it persists at more elevated levels even as we lap the effects of a year ago.

Last week Tesla (TSLA) boss Elon Musk said his business was abandoning plans to accept bitcoin as payment, citing environmental concerns.\n\nRead more: How bad is bitcoin for the environment?\n\nIn a blog post this week, the Ethereum Foundation \u2014 a non-profit that works to maintain the network underpinning the digital asset \u2014 said it would soon shift ethereum to a new infrastructure that would \"end the process of expending a country\u2019s worth of energy on consensus.\"\n\nDevelopers plan to shift ethereum from a \"proof of work\" system to a \"proof of stake\" system.\u00a0\n\nWatch: What are the risks of investing in cryptocurrency?\n\nUnder a proof of work system, computers around the world complete cryptographic maths equations to validate and secure transactions on the network. Solving these equations uses up huge amounts of electricity in the form of computing power. The vast power required stops one individual or group from being able to target the network and overpower it, theoretically allowing an entity to write in transactions sending themselves cryptocurrency.\u00a0\n\nUnder a proof of stake system, participants in the network simply have to prove they hold ethereum to contribute to its underlying operations. Computers \"stake\" their ethereum and in return can validate and secure transactions on the network. A majority of participants in the network must validate transactions for them to go through, which acts as a check against fraud.\n\nCarl Beekhuizen, a developer at the Ethereum Foundation, said in a blog that while there was no \"concrete statistics on energy consumption\" for ethereum, his \"ballpark\" estimates suggested the change in the infrastructure would reduce its energy usage by around 99.95%.\u00a0\n\nRead more: Bitcoin, ethereum and the blockchain technology behind decentralised finance\n\n\"A Proof-of-Stake Ethereum therefore consumes something on the order of 2.62 megawatt,\" Beekhuizen wrote. \"This is not on the scale of countries, provinces, or even cities, but that of a small town (around 2,100 American homes).\n\n\"For reference, Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus on Ethereum currently consumes the energy equivalent of a medium-sized country.\"\n\nAnalysts at Bank of America said in March that ethereum was estimated to be using the same amount of energy each year as Cuba.\n\nBeekhuizen said a proof of stake system would mean energy usage is uncorrelated with price. Under the current system, ethereum's energy usage rises and falls in line with its price.\n\nThe planned transition comes as cryptocurrencies face heightened scrutiny of their environmental impact. Elon Musk was forced to abandon plans for Tesla to accept bitcoin (BTC-USD) as payment, following a backlash linked to the cryptocurrency's environmental impact.\u00a0\n\nBitcoin also uses a proof of work model. Its underlying network uses more energy per year than Ukraine. Analysts at Bank of America said earlier this year that investors had to \"pay attention to the enormous environmental costs of Bitcoin\".\n\nRead more: Tesla's bitcoin investment has carbon footprint of 1.8 million cars\n\nBeekhuizen said ethereum's new infrastructure means each transaction should use the same amount of electricity as \"about 20 minutes of TV.\"\n\n\"By contrast, Ethereum PoW uses the equivalent energy of a house for 2.8 days per transaction and Bitcoin consumes 38 house-days worth,\" he wrote.\n\nThe changes will have major implications for the environmental impact of the broader cryptocurrency space. Ethereum is used as the infrastructure for many other cryptocurrency projects and so-called \"decentralized finance\" applications.\n\nShifting ethereum from proof of work to proof of stake has been planned for years but the plan has been beset by political and technical problems. Beekhuizen said the infrastructure was now up and running and being tested. The foundation hopes to complete the shift in the \"upcoming months\".\n\nBank of America analysts said earlier this year that the shift to proof of stake \"could reduce Ether's carbon footprint\" but warned it would \"increase both the social and governance risks of this crypto-currency.\"\n\nNews of the looming shift came as ethereum and other cryptocurrencies crashed to the lowest point in months. A broad sell-off hit the market on Wednesday, wiping out billions. Ethereum dropped as much as 40% on the day before recovering on Thursday.\n\nWatch: How to prevent getting into debt\n"}, {"headline": "Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies plunge on Elon Musk tweets", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Yahoo Finance UK", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/zIhIwSoKQ4ttQenOA18vrA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/89564dc0-b6e6-11eb-aff5-f9e47e3115fb", "auther": "LaToya Harding", "body": "The price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) crashed to its lowest level since the end of February after Elon Musk sparked concern that Tesla (TSLA) could sell its holdings of the cryptocurrency.\n\nLast night a Twitter account called CryptoWhale tweeted: \u201cBitcoiners are going to slap themselves next quarter when they find out Tesla dumped the rest of their holdings.

Bailey said cryptocurrencies have no \"intrinsic value\" and people who invest in them should be \"prepared to lose all [their] money.\"\n\nThe governor's comments echoed similar warnings from the UK's financial watchdog.\n\nWatch: What are the risks of investing in cryptocurrency?\n"}, {"headline": "Bitcoin stabilises as Musk backlash spawns new crypto 'stopelon'", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Yahoo Finance UK", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/rSGmryr.ySvUrmTllkkxWg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/24df1b80-9173-11eb-bf7e-03b522380442", "auther": "Saleha Riaz", "body": "Cryptocurrencies ticked up on Tuesday morning, recovering the losses from the weekend after Tesla (TSLA) chief Elon Musk sparked a sell-off.\u00a0\n\nMeanwhile, a new cryptocurrency called Stopelon has been launched purely to limit Musk's influence over the volatile market.\n\nBitcoin was up (BTC-USD) 1%, trading at $45,005.418 (\u00a331,708.12). Ethereum (ETH-USD) the second-biggest crypto by market cap, rose 0.9%, trading at $3,486.7922. Ripple (XRP-USD) was up more than 6%.\n\nEarlier, the price of bitcoin had crashed to its lowest level since the end of February.\n\nA Twitter account called CryptoWhale tweeted: \u201cBitcoiners are going to slap themselves next quarter when they find out Tesla dumped the rest of their holdings. With the amount of hate @elonmusk is getting, I wouldn\u2019t blame him\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\nMusk responded with the word \u201cindeed,\u201d which caused bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to plummet. However, later he clarified that the electric vehicle company had not sold any bitcoin.\n\nThis was after he criticised bitcoin\u2019s environmental impact last week and said Tesla would no longer accept the crypto as a form of payment. He also asked Twitter users if they would like the company to accept dogecoin (DOGE-USD), with a majority voting yes. The joke token was down 2% on Tuesday.\n\nNaeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Ava Tade, said: \"Crypto prices are stabilising today as investors see the current sell-off as an opportunity to bag some bargains. Bitcoin is certainly oversold and it is approaching its 200 days simple moving average on the daily timeframe, which is a great opportunity.\"\n\nEarlier, he had said the bitcoin sell-off was mainly due to Musk \"but the reality is that bitcoin lost its upward momentum a long time ago.\"\n\nRead more: Why Elon Musk's bitcoin and dogecoin tweets don't break rules\n\n\"It was clear that bitcoin prices went too far, and a correction was due. This correction is taking place now, and it is likely that we may see the bitcoin price decline further.\"\n\n\"When combining fundamentals such as positive net inflows of bitcoin to exchanges... we can ignore what large egos and influencers say, and see that a pullback was bound to happen,\" said Justin Chuh, senior trader at digital asset investment manager Wave Financial.\u00a0\n\n\"But we have to accept that those voices chirping around on social media aren\u2019t helping and can actually make moves. This is healthy, but I think we all wish this didn\u2019t happen.\"\n\nChuh isn't the only one who doesn't appreciate that Musk's statements and tweets can have an instant and major impact on crypto prices.\u00a0\n\nThe founding community of stopelon said: \u201cElon Musk is infamous for irresponsibly manipulating the cryptocurrency market with his Twitter account. He\u2019s toying with people\u2019s portfolio like candy, like the narcissistic billionaire he is and always will be. We say ENOUGH. Hence, we created $STOPELON.\u201d\n\nAccording to Benzinga, stopelon's plan is to use the capital raised through the project to gain control of Tesla stock and fire Musk.\n\nSTOPELON's price increased by 512% from a 24-hour low of $0.000001756 to a high of $0.000010756 before correcting by over 58% to its current price of $0.000006797, the report said.\n"}]}, {"id": "USD/CHF",

However, many made strong recoveries on the day and stocks rallied off the lows. Let\u2019s look at a few top stock trades for Thursday.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nEthereum (CCC:ETH-USD) had been on a powerful rally not that long ago. However, it\u2019s been under pressure since topping out earlier this month and then finally broke down on Wednesday.\n\nAt the session low, Ethereum was down 37% today! However, from the lows, it\u2019s actually up 40%, curbing its one-day losses to \u201cjust\u201d 23% at the moment. The volatility has been wild, to say the least.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNow back above the 50-day and 10-week moving averages, bulls need to see Ethereum hold above these measures. At the very least, it has to hold above $2,550.\n\nIf ETH loses the $2,500 mark, we can\u2019t rule out a return to this week\u2019s low. Luckily, shares caught a bounce right where we had the breakout marked, near $2,000.\n-  7 High Quality Industrial Stocks to Buy Now \n\nOn the upside, however, let\u2019s see how Ethereum does on a test of its 10-day moving average. Above it could put the $3,500 mark and the 21-day moving average in play.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has been range bound since last summer, although $74 continues to hold as support.\n\nOn the upside, we want to see a rally back to $80, where AMD stock will find its 10-week and 50-week moving averages. Above these measures puts the 21-week on the table, followed by resistance at $88.\n\nOn a break below last week\u2019s low at $72.50, it\u2019s possible we see a move lower. In that scenario, keep an eye on the 21-month moving average. If for some reason AMD stock breaks below that measure, the $60 breakout level could be in play.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nWhile other retailers have struggled despite strong earnings results, Target (NYSE:TGT) is doing quite well.\n\nShares are pushing higher on Wednesday, running into its prior highs. From here I\u2019d love to see a push up to the 161.8% extension near $220. Above that puts the two-times range extension at $233 in play.\n-  7 Blue-Chip Stocks Looking Better Than Ever \n\nOn the downside, though, keep an eye on $210. Losing that mark likely puts it below the 10-day and 21-day moving averages, and puts the 10-week and 50-day moving averages on the table. For now, bulls are in control with this one.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nUnlike Target, TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) is not responding well to earnings. However, that\u2019s not the end of the world, either.\n\nShares are trading right down into the 21-week moving average, a measure that has been support all year. If it holds, look to see if TJX stock can reclaim the 10-week.\n\nIf it fails to do so, it\u2019s possible we see a retest of the pre-coronavirus highs near $65, with more support sitting in the low $60s.\n\nBack above $71, and TJX stock could retest the all-time highs.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nJD.com (NASDAQ:JD) was trading really well coming into 2021, but like other growth stocks, it has struggled mightily since topping out in mid-February.\n\nAfter cascading lower, JD stock quickly saw its short-term moving averages turn from support to resistance, while it failed to reclaim $85. This combination should have kept bulls out of the name.\n\nThen it failed to hold the $78 to $79 area and 50-week moving average, which also turned to resistance. Are you sensing a pattern?\n\nNow trying to hold last week\u2019s low near $66.50, let\u2019s navigate this one. On the upside, see how JD stock does on a retest of the $77 to $80 area, if it can get there. There it finds current resistance, but it also finds the 10-day, 10-month and 50-week moving averages.\n\nA close below $66.50 likely puts the 21-month moving average and the $60 area in play.\n\nOn the date of publication, Bret Kenwell held a long position in AMD.

A put is a right but not an obligation to sell an asset while a call is the right but not an obligation to buy an asset \u2013 both within a specific time frame, known as expiration.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s an intriguing development because bitcoin has not been at the $50,000 price level in over a week and it\u2019s possibly a sign smart options traders are taking both sides of the trade at that level.\n\n\u201cThe open interest doesn\u2019t indicate directionality,\u201d noted Vishal Shah, founder of crypto derivatives exchange Alpha5.\n\nSince the beginning of April, 30-day volatility for 10 brand-name crypto assets on the CoinDesk 20 have all climbed, including bitcoin. However, it is ethereum classic (ETC) and ether that are in the stratosphere of wild price gyrations. Both assets have over 30-day volatility at 250% as of closing data from Thursday.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe part that stands out the most is that volatility has exploded recently, with many assets experiencing over 200% realized, which is huge,\u201d said Rich Rosenblum, president of crypto market maker GSR. \u201cThen, at the same time, BTC volatility is elevated vs. its lull a few weeks ago, but certainly muted relative to the rest, staying at under 100%.\u201d\n\nGreg Magadini, chief executive officer, Genesis Volatility, noted that ETH\u2019s \u201cDVOL\u201d metric, which is a volatility measure similar to traditional markets\u2019 VIX and tracked by options exchange Deribit, is up to 180. It\u2019s record high was Thursday, at 190. He says realized volatility, which is derived from analyzing historical returns, is now priced into the market.\u00a0\n\n\u201cAlthough we\u2019ve come down from peak realized volatility seen in the past few days, over +300%, volatility is known to cluster,\u201d said Magadini. \u201cThe options markets are pricing in over +100% implied volatility for all expirations and about 150% for near-dated options.\u201d\n\nEther, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was trading around $2,363 as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET), slipping 15.5% over the prior 24 hours. The asset is below the 10-hour moving average as well as the 50-day, a bearish signal for market technicians.\u00a0\n\nEther dumped from $2,740 around 14:15 UTC (10:15 a.m. ET) to $2,426 by 16:15 UTC (12:15 p.m. ET), a $314 decrease based on CoinDesk 20 data. ETH is still slipping, at $2,363 as of press time.\u00a0\n\nNick Mancini, research analyst at crypto sentiment analytics platform Trade the Chain, says major blockchain assets like bitcoin and ether are still seen positively, despite recent price dumps and volatility jumps.\u00a0\n\n\u201cGoing forward, long-term sentiment scores for most crypto, especially bitcoin and ether, are still high, in the 70s, despite all of the recent turmoil,\u201d Mancini. \u201cwhich means the bullish thesis remains intact.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe bullish thesis may be holding overall, but traders have clearly been losing some interest in ether versus other cryptocurrencies. Ether\u2019s dominance, its share of the greater cryptocurrency market, has started to drop.

Dogecoin (DOGE-USD), a Musk favourite, was down 21% on Wednesday to $0.37.\n\nMusk signalled some support for bitcoin as selling gripped the market.

It is now around 45% below record highs reached earlier in the year. The cryptocurrency remains up 15% since the start of the year, following a spectacular rally that began last October.\n\nBitcoin's run-up was initially fuelled by the embrace of mainstream institutions. Banks, payment companies like Square (SQ) and PayPal (PYPL), and tech businesses such as Tesla or MicroStrategy (MSTR) all announced they were either working with or investing in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. MicroStrategy has put over $2bn into bitcoin and this week invested another $10m into buying into the price dip.

Sentiment was hit by continued concerns over inflation.\n\nRead more: Why are investors afraid of inflation?\u00a0\n\nRecent crypto price declines have sparked angry debate and recriminations among small time investors.

The answer is, for those watching closely, it likely strengthened it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s why: bitcoin proved itself on Wednesday when it saw its second biggest volume day of the year, and market infrastructure did not break. Some exchanges suffered outages, but liquidity was available, as spot volumes show. Moreover, while a drop of over 30% may be dizzying for new buyers high on hopium, such events are not uncommon in bitcoin\u2019s bull-market history.\n\nThe chart above shows bitcoin-dollar volume on the 11 exchanges that are eligible as components of the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX). That means these markets are accessible to U.S. investors, have transparent ownership and do not place limits on bitcoin or dollar withdrawals, among other criteria.\u00a0\n\nRelated: CME Returns to Second Place in Latest Rankings of Bitcoin Futures Exchanges\n\nThe chart shows how the May 19 selloff compared, in bitcoin terms, to volume traded in the Jan. 10 selloff, as Dogecoin and GameStop mania peaked on Jan. 22, and during a second sell-off in February.\n\nThe bitcoin-dollar markets in general are useful to watch, because they can indicate activity at a well-known market entry point \u2013 a place where new entrants \u201cbuying the dip\u201d are likely to place orders.\u00a0\n\nMore narrowly, XBX eligibility means these exchanges can attract institutional activity as well. In particular, LMAX Digital serves institutional clients exclusively, and Coinbase (marked here as Coinbase Pro) volume is 64% institutional, according to the company\u2019s latest earnings report.\n\n(To get insights like this in your inbox every Monday,\u00a0sign up for CoinDesk Indexes\u2019 weekly newsletter, \u201cThe Hard Fork\u201d.)\n\nRelated: Market Wrap: China Breaks Crypto as Bitcoin Falls to $36K, ETH Drops $300 in Two Hours\n\nCoinbase specifically set records on Wednesday, handling over $4 billion in notional BTC/USD volume for the first time. (It was not a record in bitcoin units. That record was set Dec. 13 2015, when 165,543 BTC changed hands on Coinbase dollar markets. For context, December 2015 saw bitcoin trading up into the $400s, four months into a bull market that would last through December 2017.) Coinbase ETH/USD markets also handled record volume in both ETH and dollar terms on Wednesday, 1.7 million ETH valued in aggregate at $4.5 billion.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe fact that spot market volume can crescendo like this is an indicator of market maturity, at least in these two blue-chip cryptocurrencies: capital is able to flow in as the price drops, and sellers are finding buyers on the way down.\u00a0\n\nMeanwhile, in offshore derivatives markets, all was normal. Wednesday put this week over $4 billion in bitcoin futures liquidations.\u00a0\n\nAs this chart, pulled Thursday from skew.com, shows, this past week was only the third highest week for liquidations so far in 2021, and it\u2019s the fourth time this year that bitcoin futures liquidations have crossed $4 billion in notional value. Offshore futures markets did not artificially flash-crash the price.\u00a0\n\nWednesday\u2019s bitcoin price drop was swifter and deeper than any so far this year. The CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX) low, struck in the wee hours UTC time at $30,037.61, was 54% off its all-time high, 41% off its price before Elon started tweeting and 30% off the prior day\u2019s closing price at midnight UTC.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s the third time this year bitcoin has entered \u201cbear market\u201d territory, by equity markets\u2019 rule of thumb, which is a 20% drop. The two prior occasions occurred as the XBX made its way to its current all-time high ($64,888.19, set on April 14). Some bear market.\n\nOn any time scale, a 30% intra-day drop is unusual for bitcoin. Matt Weller of forex.com presented this illustrative chart Wednesday afternoon on All About Bitcoin on CoinDesk TV.\u00a0\n\nThe chart shows how, in the bull market that began in the second half of 2015, bitcoin saw eight drawdowns of 30% or more. None of them took place in the course of a single 24-hour day. But they all took place during a longer upward trend that took bitcoin\u2019s price from $200 to $20,000.\n\nThe current bull market dates back to March 2020, when bitcoin hit a yearly low of $3,905. If this bull market grows to resemble that period, it will put bitcoin on course to hit the $400,000 mark by July 2022.

So far this month, those concerns have won out and dragged on the indexes, with the S&P 500 down 1.3% for May-to-date and the Nasdaq down 4.7%.\u00a0\n\n\"We've been telling our clients that we're probably entering a period where there's going to be increased chop going forward,\" Matt Orton, Carillon Tower Advisors, told Yahoo Finance. \"We've had a pretty extreme rotation from growth into value. We've seen fits and starts of rotating back into the growth.\"\n\n\"Now investors need to digest what could potentially be happening with inflation,\" he added. \"But what we like to remind folks is that as we move sideways, any sort of meaningful downside you see should be used opportunistically, because earnings have been strong, guidance from companies has been incredibly strong going forward. The economy is starting to accelerate as we reopen. So there's a lot of reasons to continue owning equities, and it's all about having a game plan.\"\u00a0\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal Reserve released its April meeting minutes Wednesday afternoon, showing that \"participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee\u2019s maximum-employment and price-stability goals,\" and suggesting that they did not believe a near-term adjustment to monetary policy was not imminent. However, the minutes covered the Federal Open Market Committee's meeting from before the release of the much weaker-than-expected April jobs report and government print showing a much greater-than-expected increase in consumer prices, rendering them somewhat outdated.\u00a0\n\n\u2014\n\nHere were the main moves in markets as of 4:03 p.m. ET:\n- S&P 500 (^GSPC): -12.04 (-0.29%) to 4,115.79\n- Dow (^DJI): -163.17 (-0.48%) to 33,897.49\n- Nasdaq (^IXIC): -3.90 (-0.03%) to 13,299.74\n- Crude (CL=F): -$2.17 (-3.31%) to $63.32 a barrel\n- Gold (GC=F): +$3.60 (+0.19%) to $1,871.60 per ounce\n- 10-year Treasury (^TNX): +4.1 bps to yield 1.6830%\n\n\u2014\n\nThe Federal Reserve's April meeting minutes Wednesday afternoon reinforced that most Federal Open Market Committee members did not think QE tapering or rate increases were needed in the near-term, given the distance the economy still needs to make up to reach the Fed's employment and price stability goals.\u00a0\n\n\"Participants observed that economic activity had picked up sharply this year, with robust gains in consumer spending, housing-sector activity, business equipment investment, and manufacturing production,\" according to the minutes. \"They noted that the acceleration in economic activity reflected positive developments associated with the rapid pace of vaccinations as well as continued support from fiscal and monetary policies. Nevertheless, participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee\u2019s maximum-employment and price-stability goals.\"\u00a0\n\n\u2014\n\nWednesday's stock drop put the three major indexes on pace for a third straight day of losses, as well as their fifth down day over the past seven sessions. However, some strategists said the pullback was to be expected given the strength of the run-up so far this year up until May, and noted it did not reflect a worsening in economic or company fundamentals.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe pullback here has gotten a little deeper over the last couple of trading sessions, not necessarily threatening technically important lines of support,\u201d Mark Luschini, Janney Montgomery Scott chief investment strategist, told Yahoo Finance. \"We bounced off [the lows] on an intraday basis today. We'll see if it holds or if we need to do a little bit more work on the downside to kind of flush out some of the sentiment that'd gotten perhaps a little bit overly exuberant relative to this advance that we've had earlier this year.\"\n\n\"In the context of the market, we're still up over 8% on a year-to-date basis. The economic conditions fundamentally are still very supportive for stock prices,\" he added. \"We had, once again, a little concern here recently on inflation. Obviously the big risk at the moment is that it's not so transitory in nature and that it persists at more elevated levels even as we lap the effects of a year ago. And that, the jury is still out on.\"\u00a0\n\n\u2014\n\nHere's where markets were trading as of 12:13 p.m. ET:\u00a0\n- S&P 500 (^GSPC): -33.55 points (-0.81%) to 4,094.28\n- Dow (^DJI): -323.71 points (-0.95%) to 33,736.95\n- Nasdaq (^IXIC): -85.51 points (-0.64%) to 13,218.65\u00a0\n- Crude (CL=F): -$2.47 (-3.77%) to $63.02 a barrel\n- Gold (GC=F): +$17.60 (+0.94%) to $1,885.60 per ounce\n- 10-year Treasury (^TNX): -0.7 bps to yield 1.635%\n\n\u2014\n\nMajor cryptocurrency platforms including Binance and Coinbase (COIN) experienced service disruptions as volatility in bitcoin (BTC-USD), ethereum (ETH-USD) and other cryptocurrencies skyrocketed Wednesday.\n\nCoinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S., wrote in a status update Wednesday morning that it was investigating delays in withdrawals for ethereum and ERC-20 tokens due to network congestion, and is experiencing intermittent downtime across the Coinbase platform.\n\n\"We\u2019re seeing some issues on Coinbase and Coinbase Pro and some features may not be functioning completely normal,\" a Coinbase spokesperson said in an email to Yahoo Finance. \"We\u2019re currently investigating these issues and will provide updates as soon as possible.\"\n\nBinance, the world's biggest crypto exchange, also announced temporary halts on ethereum and ERC-20 withdrawals. It added in a separate statement that it had temporarily suspended trading for all Binance Leveraged Tokens, with some exceptions including for BTCUP, BTCDOWN and ETHUP.\n\nShares of Coinbase fell to the lowest level since their direct listing last month, trading below $220 per share.

Shares rose more than 3% in early trading.\u00a0\n\nComparable sales soared by 22.9%, whereas a rise of just 10.1% was expected, according to Bloomberg data. Comparable digital sales grew more than 50%, and digital sales comprised nearly one-fifth of all sales during the quarter. Gross margins of 30% and adjusted earnings per share of $3.69 each exceeded estimates.\u00a0\n\nFor the second quarter, Target sees mid-to-high single digit comparable sales growth.

And later, Target expects positive single-digit comparable sales growth for the last two quarters of the year.\u00a0\n\n\"Market-share gains of more than $1 billion in the first quarter, on top of $1 billion in share gains a year ago, demonstrate Target's continued relevance with our guests, even as they have many more shopping options compared with a year ago,\" Target CEO Brian Cornell said in a statement. \"Given the trust we've built with our guests quarter after quarter and our commitment to adjusting along with them to the ongoing shifts in the macro environment, we're confident in continued comp growth in the second quarter and through the remainder of the year, as well as a healthy full-year operating margin rate.\"\u00a0\n\n\u2014\n\nLowe's (LOW) posted first-quarter earnings and sales that easily exceeded estimates, with the better-than-expected results reflecting ongoing strength in home improvement project demand as many consumers continue to work from home. Shares fell, however, to match the trend seen with Home Depot's (HD) stock yesterday even after that company also topped Q1 estimates.\u00a0\n\nFirst-quarter adjusted earnings were $3.21 per share, or better than the $2.59 expected, according to Bloomberg consensus data. And comparable sales grew 25.9%, coming in much faster than the 19.4% anticipated. U.S. comparable sales grew 24.4% over last year.

Last week Tesla (TSLA) boss Elon Musk said his business was abandoning plans to accept bitcoin as payment, citing environmental concerns.\n\nRead more: How bad is bitcoin for the environment?\n\nIn a blog post this week, the Ethereum Foundation \u2014 a non-profit that works to maintain the network underpinning the digital asset \u2014 said it would soon shift ethereum to a new infrastructure that would \"end the process of expending a country\u2019s worth of energy on consensus.\"\n\nDevelopers plan to shift ethereum from a \"proof of work\" system to a \"proof of stake\" system.\u00a0\n\nWatch: What are the risks of investing in cryptocurrency?\n\nUnder a proof of work system, computers around the world complete cryptographic maths equations to validate and secure transactions on the network. Solving these equations uses up huge amounts of electricity in the form of computing power. The vast power required stops one individual or group from being able to target the network and overpower it, theoretically allowing an entity to write in transactions sending themselves cryptocurrency.\u00a0\n\nUnder a proof of stake system, participants in the network simply have to prove they hold ethereum to contribute to its underlying operations. Computers \"stake\" their ethereum and in return can validate and secure transactions on the network. A majority of participants in the network must validate transactions for them to go through, which acts as a check against fraud.\n\nCarl Beekhuizen, a developer at the Ethereum Foundation, said in a blog that while there was no \"concrete statistics on energy consumption\" for ethereum, his \"ballpark\" estimates suggested the change in the infrastructure would reduce its energy usage by around 99.95%.\u00a0\n\nRead more: Bitcoin, ethereum and the blockchain technology behind decentralised finance\n\n\"A Proof-of-Stake Ethereum therefore consumes something on the order of 2.62 megawatt,\" Beekhuizen wrote. \"This is not on the scale of countries, provinces, or even cities, but that of a small town (around 2,100 American homes).\n\n\"For reference, Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus on Ethereum currently consumes the energy equivalent of a medium-sized country.\"\n\nAnalysts at Bank of America said in March that ethereum was estimated to be using the same amount of energy each year as Cuba.\n\nBeekhuizen said a proof of stake system would mean energy usage is uncorrelated with price. Under the current system, ethereum's energy usage rises and falls in line with its price.\n\nThe planned transition comes as cryptocurrencies face heightened scrutiny of their environmental impact. Elon Musk was forced to abandon plans for Tesla to accept bitcoin (BTC-USD) as payment, following a backlash linked to the cryptocurrency's environmental impact.\u00a0\n\nBitcoin also uses a proof of work model. Its underlying network uses more energy per year than Ukraine. Analysts at Bank of America said earlier this year that investors had to \"pay attention to the enormous environmental costs of Bitcoin\".\n\nRead more: Tesla's bitcoin investment has carbon footprint of 1.8 million cars\n\nBeekhuizen said ethereum's new infrastructure means each transaction should use the same amount of electricity as \"about 20 minutes of TV.\"\n\n\"By contrast, Ethereum PoW uses the equivalent energy of a house for 2.8 days per transaction and Bitcoin consumes 38 house-days worth,\" he wrote.\n\nThe changes will have major implications for the environmental impact of the broader cryptocurrency space. Ethereum is used as the infrastructure for many other cryptocurrency projects and so-called \"decentralized finance\" applications.\n\nShifting ethereum from proof of work to proof of stake has been planned for years but the plan has been beset by political and technical problems. Beekhuizen said the infrastructure was now up and running and being tested. The foundation hopes to complete the shift in the \"upcoming months\".\n\nBank of America analysts said earlier this year that the shift to proof of stake \"could reduce Ether's carbon footprint\" but warned it would \"increase both the social and governance risks of this crypto-currency.\"\n\nNews of the looming shift came as ethereum and other cryptocurrencies crashed to the lowest point in months. A broad sell-off hit the market on Wednesday, wiping out billions. Ethereum dropped as much as 40% on the day before recovering on Thursday.\n\nWatch: How to prevent getting into debt\n"}, {"headline": "Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies plunge on Elon Musk tweets", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Yahoo Finance UK", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/zIhIwSoKQ4ttQenOA18vrA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/89564dc0-b6e6-11eb-aff5-f9e47e3115fb", "auther": "LaToya Harding", "body": "The price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) crashed to its lowest level since the end of February after Elon Musk sparked concern that Tesla (TSLA) could sell its holdings of the cryptocurrency.\n\nLast night a Twitter account called CryptoWhale tweeted: \u201cBitcoiners are going to slap themselves next quarter when they find out Tesla dumped the rest of their holdings.

However, many made strong recoveries on the day and stocks rallied off the lows. Let\u2019s look at a few top stock trades for Thursday.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nEthereum (CCC:ETH-USD) had been on a powerful rally not that long ago. However, it\u2019s been under pressure since topping out earlier this month and then finally broke down on Wednesday.\n\nAt the session low, Ethereum was down 37% today! However, from the lows, it\u2019s actually up 40%, curbing its one-day losses to \u201cjust\u201d 23% at the moment. The volatility has been wild, to say the least.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNow back above the 50-day and 10-week moving averages, bulls need to see Ethereum hold above these measures. At the very least, it has to hold above $2,550.\n\nIf ETH loses the $2,500 mark, we can\u2019t rule out a return to this week\u2019s low. Luckily, shares caught a bounce right where we had the breakout marked, near $2,000.\n-  7 High Quality Industrial Stocks to Buy Now \n\nOn the upside, however, let\u2019s see how Ethereum does on a test of its 10-day moving average. Above it could put the $3,500 mark and the 21-day moving average in play.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has been range bound since last summer, although $74 continues to hold as support.\n\nOn the upside, we want to see a rally back to $80, where AMD stock will find its 10-week and 50-week moving averages. Above these measures puts the 21-week on the table, followed by resistance at $88.\n\nOn a break below last week\u2019s low at $72.50, it\u2019s possible we see a move lower. In that scenario, keep an eye on the 21-month moving average. If for some reason AMD stock breaks below that measure, the $60 breakout level could be in play.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nWhile other retailers have struggled despite strong earnings results, Target (NYSE:TGT) is doing quite well.\n\nShares are pushing higher on Wednesday, running into its prior highs. From here I\u2019d love to see a push up to the 161.8% extension near $220. Above that puts the two-times range extension at $233 in play.\n-  7 Blue-Chip Stocks Looking Better Than Ever \n\nOn the downside, though, keep an eye on $210. Losing that mark likely puts it below the 10-day and 21-day moving averages, and puts the 10-week and 50-day moving averages on the table. For now, bulls are in control with this one.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nUnlike Target, TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) is not responding well to earnings. However, that\u2019s not the end of the world, either.\n\nShares are trading right down into the 21-week moving average, a measure that has been support all year. If it holds, look to see if TJX stock can reclaim the 10-week.\n\nIf it fails to do so, it\u2019s possible we see a retest of the pre-coronavirus highs near $65, with more support sitting in the low $60s.\n\nBack above $71, and TJX stock could retest the all-time highs.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nJD.com (NASDAQ:JD) was trading really well coming into 2021, but like other growth stocks, it has struggled mightily since topping out in mid-February.\n\nAfter cascading lower, JD stock quickly saw its short-term moving averages turn from support to resistance, while it failed to reclaim $85. This combination should have kept bulls out of the name.\n\nThen it failed to hold the $78 to $79 area and 50-week moving average, which also turned to resistance. Are you sensing a pattern?\n\nNow trying to hold last week\u2019s low near $66.50, let\u2019s navigate this one. On the upside, see how JD stock does on a retest of the $77 to $80 area, if it can get there. There it finds current resistance, but it also finds the 10-day, 10-month and 50-week moving averages.\n\nA close below $66.50 likely puts the 21-month moving average and the $60 area in play.\n\nOn the date of publication, Bret Kenwell held a long position in AMD.

The city currently has an \"opt in\" approach under which exchanges can apply to be licensed by the Securities and Futures Commission, but this is not compulsory.\u00a0\n\nThe city's Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) said on Friday that all virtual asset (VA) exchanges should be licensed if they wished to operate in Hong Kong.\n\nIt also added \"confining the services of a VA exchange to professional investors... is appropriate at least for the initial stage of the licensing regime.\"\n\nCryptocurrencies have been struggling to regain losses from a massive sell-off earlier in the week, which saw the crypto world lose 20% of its value as deep correction hit the market. Bitcoin fell below $32,000 on Wednesday, while ethereum dropped as much as 30%.\n\n\"Crypto holders who are hoping for a rapid bounce back from this week\u2019s dramatic falls, should buckle up and expect another rollercoaster ride, Streeter added. \"Sentiment has shifted not simply because powerful influencers like Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk have stepped back from being cheerleaders for bitcoin.\"\n"}, {"headline": "Market Wrap: China Breaks Crypto as Bitcoin Falls to $36K, ETH Drops $300 in Two Hours", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "CoinDesk via Yahoo Finance", "date": "20 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/VxMmaWmxKiuDQwHcD9RlDQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDtzbT0xO3c9MTY0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/coindesk_75/81fd17c16d722db0dd9507be3a8c02f3", "auther": "Daniel Cawrey", "body": "It has been a low-volume Friday to cap an up-and-down week for cryptocurrencies.

However, the split between puts and calls is almost even. A put is a right but not an obligation to sell an asset while a call is the right but not an obligation to buy an asset \u2013 both within a specific time frame, known as expiration.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s an intriguing development because bitcoin has not been at the $50,000 price level in over a week and it\u2019s possibly a sign smart options traders are taking both sides of the trade at that level.\n\n\u201cThe open interest doesn\u2019t indicate directionality,\u201d noted Vishal Shah, founder of crypto derivatives exchange Alpha5.\n\nSince the beginning of April, 30-day volatility for 10 brand-name crypto assets on the CoinDesk 20 have all climbed, including bitcoin. However, it is ethereum classic (ETC) and ether that are in the stratosphere of wild price gyrations. Both assets have over 30-day volatility at 250% as of closing data from Thursday.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe part that stands out the most is that volatility has exploded recently, with many assets experiencing over 200% realized, which is huge,\u201d said Rich Rosenblum, president of crypto market maker GSR. \u201cThen, at the same time, BTC volatility is elevated vs. its lull a few weeks ago, but certainly muted relative to the rest, staying at under 100%.\u201d\n\nGreg Magadini, chief executive officer, Genesis Volatility, noted that ETH\u2019s \u201cDVOL\u201d metric, which is a volatility measure similar to traditional markets\u2019 VIX and tracked by options exchange Deribit, is up to 180. It\u2019s record high was Thursday, at 190. He says realized volatility, which is derived from analyzing historical returns, is now priced into the market.\u00a0\n\n\u201cAlthough we\u2019ve come down from peak realized volatility seen in the past few days, over +300%, volatility is known to cluster,\u201d said Magadini. \u201cThe options markets are pricing in over +100% implied volatility for all expirations and about 150% for near-dated options.\u201d\n\nEther, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was trading around $2,363 as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET), slipping 15.5% over the prior 24 hours. The asset is below the 10-hour moving average as well as the 50-day, a bearish signal for market technicians.\u00a0\n\nEther dumped from $2,740 around 14:15 UTC (10:15 a.m. ET) to $2,426 by 16:15 UTC (12:15 p.m. ET), a $314 decrease based on CoinDesk 20 data. ETH is still slipping, at $2,363 as of press time.\u00a0\n\nNick Mancini, research analyst at crypto sentiment analytics platform Trade the Chain, says major blockchain assets like bitcoin and ether are still seen positively, despite recent price dumps and volatility jumps.\u00a0\n\n\u201cGoing forward, long-term sentiment scores for most crypto, especially bitcoin and ether, are still high, in the 70s, despite all of the recent turmoil,\u201d Mancini. \u201cwhich means the bullish thesis remains intact.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe bullish thesis may be holding overall, but traders have clearly been losing some interest in ether versus other cryptocurrencies. Ether\u2019s dominance, its share of the greater cryptocurrency market, has started to drop. After hitting a 2021 high of 20.61% May 15, ETH dominance has started to falter, below 18% share and down 2% the past 24 hours as of press time.\n\nRead More: US Seeks Information About $1.4M EtherDelta Hack in 2017\n\nDigital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are all red Friday.

By mid-afternoon, it was still down 22% to trade at $2,642.\n\nDate provider CoinMarketCap.com was reporting that the value of the entire cryptocurrency market had fallen by 20% over the 24 hours. The sell-off wiped approximately $350bn off the market's value.\u00a0\n\nThe price declines coincided with a renewed crackdown on cryptocurrencies from the People\u2019s Bank of China. The central bank issued a statement on its WeChat account reiterating that financial institutions should not accept or deal with cryptocurrencies, the Financial Times reported.\n\n\"China has for some time been putting pressure on the crypto space, but this marks an intensification,\" said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com. \"Other countries might follow now as central banks make strides towards their own digital currencies.\"\n\nWatch: What is bitcoin?\n\nWednesday's slump extended a slide that began last week after Tesla (TSLA) boss Elon Musk announced his company would no longer pursue plans to accept bitcoin as payment for its electrical cars. Musk \u2014 a long-time crypto advocate \u2014 cited environmental concerns. Dogecoin (DOGE-USD), a Musk favourite, was down 21% on Wednesday to $0.37.\n\nMusk signalled some support for bitcoin as selling gripped the market. The billionaire tweeted emojis signalling Tesla had \"diamond hands\" \u2014 crypto-speak for a person or company that will hold on to a position no matter what. Tesla disclosed a $1.5bn investment in bitcoin earlier this year, although it has since sold some of its holding.\n\nTesla has \ud83d\udc8e \ud83d\ude4c\n\n\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 19, 2021\n\nRead more: Bitcoin, Dogecoin sink after Elon Musk walks back Tesla's support for crypto transactions\n\nBitcoin has fallen over 35% since Musk's publicly said Tesla was abandoning its payment plans. It is now around 45% below record highs reached earlier in the year. The cryptocurrency remains up 15% since the start of the year, following a spectacular rally that began last October.\n\nBitcoin's run-up was initially fuelled by the embrace of mainstream institutions. Banks, payment companies like Square (SQ) and PayPal (PYPL), and tech businesses such as Tesla or MicroStrategy (MSTR) all announced they were either working with or investing in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. MicroStrategy has put over $2bn into bitcoin and this week invested another $10m into buying into the price dip. Shares in the company slumped 11% at the open in New York.\n\nRead more: How bad is bitcoin for the environment?\n\nMore recently, crypto gains have been fuelled by retail investors piling into the market to take advantage of price momentum. With price growth stalling in recent weeks, some have begun to exit positions.\n\n\"The crypto bubble has started to unravel and data from different exchanges suggest that retail investors are capitulating,\" said Giacomo Pierantoni, a research analyst at Vanda, which produces proprietary data on retail investment flows.\n\nInstitutional interest has been fading too, according to JP Morgan.\n\n\"Institutional investors appear to be shifting away from bitcoin and back into traditional gold, reversing the trend of the previous two quarters,\" the investment bank said in a note sent to clients this week.\n\nJP Morgan and other market watchers had warned that crypto and other asset classes were looking dangerously like a bubble.\n\n\"The market has been looking to the news around Tesla and regulatory headwinds out of China as reasons behind the turnaround, though we have been warning for some time that a correction was due given the pace of the bull run this year,\" said Joel Kruger, cryptocurrency strategist at LMAX Digital, said.\n\n\"Much like the Tesla story, we think assigning the pullback to the China news would be a gross exaggeration of the reality that this is indeed a market that has run too far and fast and a market that is still very much correlated to broader risk sentiment.\"\n\nWednesday's sell-off coincided with a broader move away from riskier investments like equities across global markets. Sentiment was hit by continued concerns over inflation.\n\nRead more: Why are investors afraid of inflation?\u00a0\n\nRecent crypto price declines have sparked angry debate and recriminations among small time investors. Still, many institutional investors and analysts who follow the space remain optimistic about its long-term prospects.\n\n\"Bitcoin's pattern over the last 10 years has been meteoric rises followed by pull-backs,\" said Joe DiPasquale, chief executive of BitBull Capital. \"The trends has been higher highs and higher lows: one year ago today, bitcoin closed at $9,927 while it now sits at about $39K.\u00a0\n\n\"While it's certainly fallen from its $63K high, that is still a 300% rise. The fall in price is a natural consolidation period that we see as necessary for the support lines to form for future appreciation.

The answer is, for those watching closely, it likely strengthened it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s why: bitcoin proved itself on Wednesday when it saw its second biggest volume day of the year, and market infrastructure did not break. Some exchanges suffered outages, but liquidity was available, as spot volumes show. Moreover, while a drop of over 30% may be dizzying for new buyers high on hopium, such events are not uncommon in bitcoin\u2019s bull-market history.\n\nThe chart above shows bitcoin-dollar volume on the 11 exchanges that are eligible as components of the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX). That means these markets are accessible to U.S. investors, have transparent ownership and do not place limits on bitcoin or dollar withdrawals, among other criteria.\u00a0\n\nRelated: CME Returns to Second Place in Latest Rankings of Bitcoin Futures Exchanges\n\nThe chart shows how the May 19 selloff compared, in bitcoin terms, to volume traded in the Jan. 10 selloff, as Dogecoin and GameStop mania peaked on Jan. 22, and during a second sell-off in February.\n\nThe bitcoin-dollar markets in general are useful to watch, because they can indicate activity at a well-known market entry point \u2013 a place where new entrants \u201cbuying the dip\u201d are likely to place orders.\u00a0\n\nMore narrowly, XBX eligibility means these exchanges can attract institutional activity as well. In particular, LMAX Digital serves institutional clients exclusively, and Coinbase (marked here as Coinbase Pro) volume is 64% institutional, according to the company\u2019s latest earnings report.\n\n(To get insights like this in your inbox every Monday,\u00a0sign up for CoinDesk Indexes\u2019 weekly newsletter, \u201cThe Hard Fork\u201d.)\n\nRelated: Market Wrap: China Breaks Crypto as Bitcoin Falls to $36K, ETH Drops $300 in Two Hours\n\nCoinbase specifically set records on Wednesday, handling over $4 billion in notional BTC/USD volume for the first time. (It was not a record in bitcoin units. That record was set Dec. 13 2015, when 165,543 BTC changed hands on Coinbase dollar markets. For context, December 2015 saw bitcoin trading up into the $400s, four months into a bull market that would last through December 2017.) Coinbase ETH/USD markets also handled record volume in both ETH and dollar terms on Wednesday, 1.7 million ETH valued in aggregate at $4.5 billion.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe fact that spot market volume can crescendo like this is an indicator of market maturity, at least in these two blue-chip cryptocurrencies: capital is able to flow in as the price drops, and sellers are finding buyers on the way down.\u00a0\n\nMeanwhile, in offshore derivatives markets, all was normal. Wednesday put this week over $4 billion in bitcoin futures liquidations.\u00a0\n\nAs this chart, pulled Thursday from skew.com, shows, this past week was only the third highest week for liquidations so far in 2021, and it\u2019s the fourth time this year that bitcoin futures liquidations have crossed $4 billion in notional value. Offshore futures markets did not artificially flash-crash the price.\u00a0\n\nWednesday\u2019s bitcoin price drop was swifter and deeper than any so far this year. The CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX) low, struck in the wee hours UTC time at $30,037.61, was 54% off its all-time high, 41% off its price before Elon started tweeting and 30% off the prior day\u2019s closing price at midnight UTC.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s the third time this year bitcoin has entered \u201cbear market\u201d territory, by equity markets\u2019 rule of thumb, which is a 20% drop. The two prior occasions occurred as the XBX made its way to its current all-time high ($64,888.19, set on April 14). Some bear market.\n\nOn any time scale, a 30% intra-day drop is unusual for bitcoin. Matt Weller of forex.com presented this illustrative chart Wednesday afternoon on All About Bitcoin on CoinDesk TV.\u00a0\n\nThe chart shows how, in the bull market that began in the second half of 2015, bitcoin saw eight drawdowns of 30% or more. None of them took place in the course of a single 24-hour day. But they all took place during a longer upward trend that took bitcoin\u2019s price from $200 to $20,000.\n\nThe current bull market dates back to March 2020, when bitcoin hit a yearly low of $3,905. If this bull market grows to resemble that period, it will put bitcoin on course to hit the $400,000 mark by July 2022. That\u2019s a big if, but also a popular one.\n- Ray Dalio, Wall Street\u2019s \u2018Oddest Duck,\u2019 Shares the Bitcoin Mind\n- \u2018Grayscale Discount\u2019 Narrows to 10% and Could Shrink More as Lockups Expire\n"}, {"headline": "Stock market news live updates: Stocks log third straight day of losses as technology stocks slide", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Yahoo Finance", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/LOkwytjIRJzVmBpUe__YZQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/df099790-97d8-11eb-bffb-90dd619e59aa", "auther": "Emily McCormick", "body": "Stocks logged a third straight day of declines as inflation concerns persisted.\n\n[Click here to read what's moving markets heading into Thursday, May 20]\n\nThe Nasdaq underperformed, and the index opened lower by more than 1.5% before paring some losses.

However, the minutes covered the Federal Open Market Committee's meeting from before the release of the much weaker-than-expected April jobs report and government print showing a much greater-than-expected increase in consumer prices, rendering them somewhat outdated.\u00a0\n\n\u2014\n\nHere were the main moves in markets as of 4:03 p.m. ET:\n- S&P 500 (^GSPC): -12.04 (-0.29%) to 4,115.79\n- Dow (^DJI): -163.17 (-0.48%) to 33,897.49\n- Nasdaq (^IXIC): -3.90 (-0.03%) to 13,299.74\n- Crude (CL=F): -$2.17 (-3.31%) to $63.32 a barrel\n- Gold (GC=F): +$3.60 (+0.19%) to $1,871.60 per ounce\n- 10-year Treasury (^TNX): +4.1 bps to yield 1.6830%\n\n\u2014\n\nThe Federal Reserve's April meeting minutes Wednesday afternoon reinforced that most Federal Open Market Committee members did not think QE tapering or rate increases were needed in the near-term, given the distance the economy still needs to make up to reach the Fed's employment and price stability goals.\u00a0\n\n\"Participants observed that economic activity had picked up sharply this year, with robust gains in consumer spending, housing-sector activity, business equipment investment, and manufacturing production,\" according to the minutes. \"They noted that the acceleration in economic activity reflected positive developments associated with the rapid pace of vaccinations as well as continued support from fiscal and monetary policies. Nevertheless, participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee\u2019s maximum-employment and price-stability goals.\"\u00a0\n\n\u2014\n\nWednesday's stock drop put the three major indexes on pace for a third straight day of losses, as well as their fifth down day over the past seven sessions. However, some strategists said the pullback was to be expected given the strength of the run-up so far this year up until May, and noted it did not reflect a worsening in economic or company fundamentals.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe pullback here has gotten a little deeper over the last couple of trading sessions, not necessarily threatening technically important lines of support,\u201d Mark Luschini, Janney Montgomery Scott chief investment strategist, told Yahoo Finance. \"We bounced off [the lows] on an intraday basis today. We'll see if it holds or if we need to do a little bit more work on the downside to kind of flush out some of the sentiment that'd gotten perhaps a little bit overly exuberant relative to this advance that we've had earlier this year.\"\n\n\"In the context of the market, we're still up over 8% on a year-to-date basis. The economic conditions fundamentally are still very supportive for stock prices,\" he added. \"We had, once again, a little concern here recently on inflation.

Last week Tesla (TSLA) boss Elon Musk said his business was abandoning plans to accept bitcoin as payment, citing environmental concerns.\n\nRead more: How bad is bitcoin for the environment?\n\nIn a blog post this week, the Ethereum Foundation \u2014 a non-profit that works to maintain the network underpinning the digital asset \u2014 said it would soon shift ethereum to a new infrastructure that would \"end the process of expending a country\u2019s worth of energy on consensus.\"\n\nDevelopers plan to shift ethereum from a \"proof of work\" system to a \"proof of stake\" system.\u00a0\n\nWatch: What are the risks of investing in cryptocurrency?\n\nUnder a proof of work system, computers around the world complete cryptographic maths equations to validate and secure transactions on the network. Solving these equations uses up huge amounts of electricity in the form of computing power. The vast power required stops one individual or group from being able to target the network and overpower it, theoretically allowing an entity to write in transactions sending themselves cryptocurrency.\u00a0\n\nUnder a proof of stake system, participants in the network simply have to prove they hold ethereum to contribute to its underlying operations. Computers \"stake\" their ethereum and in return can validate and secure transactions on the network. A majority of participants in the network must validate transactions for them to go through, which acts as a check against fraud.\n\nCarl Beekhuizen, a developer at the Ethereum Foundation, said in a blog that while there was no \"concrete statistics on energy consumption\" for ethereum, his \"ballpark\" estimates suggested the change in the infrastructure would reduce its energy usage by around 99.95%.\u00a0\n\nRead more: Bitcoin, ethereum and the blockchain technology behind decentralised finance\n\n\"A Proof-of-Stake Ethereum therefore consumes something on the order of 2.62 megawatt,\" Beekhuizen wrote. \"This is not on the scale of countries, provinces, or even cities, but that of a small town (around 2,100 American homes).\n\n\"For reference, Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus on Ethereum currently consumes the energy equivalent of a medium-sized country.\"\n\nAnalysts at Bank of America said in March that ethereum was estimated to be using the same amount of energy each year as Cuba.\n\nBeekhuizen said a proof of stake system would mean energy usage is uncorrelated with price. Under the current system, ethereum's energy usage rises and falls in line with its price.\n\nThe planned transition comes as cryptocurrencies face heightened scrutiny of their environmental impact. Elon Musk was forced to abandon plans for Tesla to accept bitcoin (BTC-USD) as payment, following a backlash linked to the cryptocurrency's environmental impact.\u00a0\n\nBitcoin also uses a proof of work model. Its underlying network uses more energy per year than Ukraine. Analysts at Bank of America said earlier this year that investors had to \"pay attention to the enormous environmental costs of Bitcoin\".\n\nRead more: Tesla's bitcoin investment has carbon footprint of 1.8 million cars\n\nBeekhuizen said ethereum's new infrastructure means each transaction should use the same amount of electricity as \"about 20 minutes of TV.\"\n\n\"By contrast, Ethereum PoW uses the equivalent energy of a house for 2.8 days per transaction and Bitcoin consumes 38 house-days worth,\" he wrote.\n\nThe changes will have major implications for the environmental impact of the broader cryptocurrency space. Ethereum is used as the infrastructure for many other cryptocurrency projects and so-called \"decentralized finance\" applications.\n\nShifting ethereum from proof of work to proof of stake has been planned for years but the plan has been beset by political and technical problems. Beekhuizen said the infrastructure was now up and running and being tested. The foundation hopes to complete the shift in the \"upcoming months\".\n\nBank of America analysts said earlier this year that the shift to proof of stake \"could reduce Ether's carbon footprint\" but warned it would \"increase both the social and governance risks of this crypto-currency.\"\n\nNews of the looming shift came as ethereum and other cryptocurrencies crashed to the lowest point in months. A broad sell-off hit the market on Wednesday, wiping out billions. Ethereum dropped as much as 40% on the day before recovering on Thursday.\n\nWatch: How to prevent getting into debt\n"}, {"headline": "Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies plunge on Elon Musk tweets", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Yahoo Finance UK", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/zIhIwSoKQ4ttQenOA18vrA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/89564dc0-b6e6-11eb-aff5-f9e47e3115fb", "auther": "LaToya Harding", "body": "The price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) crashed to its lowest level since the end of February after Elon Musk sparked concern that Tesla (TSLA) could sell its holdings of the cryptocurrency.\n\nLast night a Twitter account called CryptoWhale tweeted: \u201cBitcoiners are going to slap themselves next quarter when they find out Tesla dumped the rest of their holdings.

Musk said: \u201cObnoxious threads like this make me want to go all in on Doge.\u201d\n\nThe comments come after Musk criticised bitcoin\u2019s environmental impact last week.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, he raised concerns about how much energy the technology uses. According to Cambridge University, bitcoin mining accounts for 0.7% of the world's electricity consumption.\n\n\"We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for bitcoin mining and transactions, especially after coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel,\" Musk tweeted.\n\nThe Tesla boss reversed a decision made just months before to accept bitcoin as payment for his electric vehicles.\n\nHowever, the billionaire later said he still \"believes in crypto\" but remains concerned about bitcoin's energy usage.\n\n\"To be clear, I strongly believe in crypto, but it can\u2019t drive a massive increase in fossil fuel use, especially coal,\" Musk said on Friday.\n\nRead more: How bad is Bitcoin for the environment?\n\n\"It is important to keep in mind that it is true that the current sell-off in bitcoin price is mainly due to Elon Musk.

However, many made strong recoveries on the day and stocks rallied off the lows. Let\u2019s look at a few top stock trades for Thursday.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nEthereum (CCC:ETH-USD) had been on a powerful rally not that long ago. However, it\u2019s been under pressure since topping out earlier this month and then finally broke down on Wednesday.\n\nAt the session low, Ethereum was down 37% today! However, from the lows, it\u2019s actually up 40%, curbing its one-day losses to \u201cjust\u201d 23% at the moment. The volatility has been wild, to say the least.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNow back above the 50-day and 10-week moving averages, bulls need to see Ethereum hold above these measures. At the very least, it has to hold above $2,550.\n\nIf ETH loses the $2,500 mark, we can\u2019t rule out a return to this week\u2019s low. Luckily, shares caught a bounce right where we had the breakout marked, near $2,000.\n-  7 High Quality Industrial Stocks to Buy Now \n\nOn the upside, however, let\u2019s see how Ethereum does on a test of its 10-day moving average. Above it could put the $3,500 mark and the 21-day moving average in play.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has been range bound since last summer, although $74 continues to hold as support.\n\nOn the upside, we want to see a rally back to $80, where AMD stock will find its 10-week and 50-week moving averages. Above these measures puts the 21-week on the table, followed by resistance at $88.\n\nOn a break below last week\u2019s low at $72.50, it\u2019s possible we see a move lower. In that scenario, keep an eye on the 21-month moving average. If for some reason AMD stock breaks below that measure, the $60 breakout level could be in play.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nWhile other retailers have struggled despite strong earnings results, Target (NYSE:TGT) is doing quite well.\n\nShares are pushing higher on Wednesday, running into its prior highs. From here I\u2019d love to see a push up to the 161.8% extension near $220. Above that puts the two-times range extension at $233 in play.\n-  7 Blue-Chip Stocks Looking Better Than Ever \n\nOn the downside, though, keep an eye on $210. Losing that mark likely puts it below the 10-day and 21-day moving averages, and puts the 10-week and 50-day moving averages on the table. For now, bulls are in control with this one.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nUnlike Target, TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) is not responding well to earnings. However, that\u2019s not the end of the world, either.\n\nShares are trading right down into the 21-week moving average, a measure that has been support all year. If it holds, look to see if TJX stock can reclaim the 10-week.\n\nIf it fails to do so, it\u2019s possible we see a retest of the pre-coronavirus highs near $65, with more support sitting in the low $60s.\n\nBack above $71, and TJX stock could retest the all-time highs.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nJD.com (NASDAQ:JD) was trading really well coming into 2021, but like other growth stocks, it has struggled mightily since topping out in mid-February.\n\nAfter cascading lower, JD stock quickly saw its short-term moving averages turn from support to resistance, while it failed to reclaim $85. This combination should have kept bulls out of the name.\n\nThen it failed to hold the $78 to $79 area and 50-week moving average, which also turned to resistance. Are you sensing a pattern?\n\nNow trying to hold last week\u2019s low near $66.50, let\u2019s navigate this one. On the upside, see how JD stock does on a retest of the $77 to $80 area, if it can get there. There it finds current resistance, but it also finds the 10-day, 10-month and 50-week moving averages.\n\nA close below $66.50 likely puts the 21-month moving average and the $60 area in play.\n\nOn the date of publication, Bret Kenwell held a long position in AMD.

The city currently has an \"opt in\" approach under which exchanges can apply to be licensed by the Securities and Futures Commission, but this is not compulsory.\u00a0\n\nThe city's Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) said on Friday that all virtual asset (VA) exchanges should be licensed if they wished to operate in Hong Kong.\n\nIt also added \"confining the services of a VA exchange to professional investors... is appropriate at least for the initial stage of the licensing regime.\"\n\nCryptocurrencies have been struggling to regain losses from a massive sell-off earlier in the week, which saw the crypto world lose 20% of its value as deep correction hit the market.

However, it is ethereum classic (ETC) and ether that are in the stratosphere of wild price gyrations. Both assets have over 30-day volatility at 250% as of closing data from Thursday.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe part that stands out the most is that volatility has exploded recently, with many assets experiencing over 200% realized, which is huge,\u201d said Rich Rosenblum, president of crypto market maker GSR. \u201cThen, at the same time, BTC volatility is elevated vs. its lull a few weeks ago, but certainly muted relative to the rest, staying at under 100%.\u201d\n\nGreg Magadini, chief executive officer, Genesis Volatility, noted that ETH\u2019s \u201cDVOL\u201d metric, which is a volatility measure similar to traditional markets\u2019 VIX and tracked by options exchange Deribit, is up to 180. It\u2019s record high was Thursday, at 190. He says realized volatility, which is derived from analyzing historical returns, is now priced into the market.\u00a0\n\n\u201cAlthough we\u2019ve come down from peak realized volatility seen in the past few days, over +300%, volatility is known to cluster,\u201d said Magadini. \u201cThe options markets are pricing in over +100% implied volatility for all expirations and about 150% for near-dated options.\u201d\n\nEther, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was trading around $2,363 as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET), slipping 15.5% over the prior 24 hours.

Ether\u2019s dominance, its share of the greater cryptocurrency market, has started to drop.

It is now around 45% below record highs reached earlier in the year. The cryptocurrency remains up 15% since the start of the year, following a spectacular rally that began last October.\n\nBitcoin's run-up was initially fuelled by the embrace of mainstream institutions. Banks, payment companies like Square (SQ) and PayPal (PYPL), and tech businesses such as Tesla or MicroStrategy (MSTR) all announced they were either working with or investing in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. MicroStrategy has put over $2bn into bitcoin and this week invested another $10m into buying into the price dip.

The answer is, for those watching closely, it likely strengthened it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s why: bitcoin proved itself on Wednesday when it saw its second biggest volume day of the year, and market infrastructure did not break. Some exchanges suffered outages, but liquidity was available, as spot volumes show. Moreover, while a drop of over 30% may be dizzying for new buyers high on hopium, such events are not uncommon in bitcoin\u2019s bull-market history.\n\nThe chart above shows bitcoin-dollar volume on the 11 exchanges that are eligible as components of the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX). That means these markets are accessible to U.S. investors, have transparent ownership and do not place limits on bitcoin or dollar withdrawals, among other criteria.\u00a0\n\nRelated: CME Returns to Second Place in Latest Rankings of Bitcoin Futures Exchanges\n\nThe chart shows how the May 19 selloff compared, in bitcoin terms, to volume traded in the Jan. 10 selloff, as Dogecoin and GameStop mania peaked on Jan. 22, and during a second sell-off in February.\n\nThe bitcoin-dollar markets in general are useful to watch, because they can indicate activity at a well-known market entry point \u2013 a place where new entrants \u201cbuying the dip\u201d are likely to place orders.\u00a0\n\nMore narrowly, XBX eligibility means these exchanges can attract institutional activity as well. In particular, LMAX Digital serves institutional clients exclusively, and Coinbase (marked here as Coinbase Pro) volume is 64% institutional, according to the company\u2019s latest earnings report.\n\n(To get insights like this in your inbox every Monday,\u00a0sign up for CoinDesk Indexes\u2019 weekly newsletter, \u201cThe Hard Fork\u201d.)\n\nRelated: Market Wrap: China Breaks Crypto as Bitcoin Falls to $36K, ETH Drops $300 in Two Hours\n\nCoinbase specifically set records on Wednesday, handling over $4 billion in notional BTC/USD volume for the first time. (It was not a record in bitcoin units. That record was set Dec. 13 2015, when 165,543 BTC changed hands on Coinbase dollar markets. For context, December 2015 saw bitcoin trading up into the $400s, four months into a bull market that would last through December 2017.) Coinbase ETH/USD markets also handled record volume in both ETH and dollar terms on Wednesday, 1.7 million ETH valued in aggregate at $4.5 billion.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe fact that spot market volume can crescendo like this is an indicator of market maturity, at least in these two blue-chip cryptocurrencies: capital is able to flow in as the price drops, and sellers are finding buyers on the way down.\u00a0\n\nMeanwhile, in offshore derivatives markets, all was normal. Wednesday put this week over $4 billion in bitcoin futures liquidations.\u00a0\n\nAs this chart, pulled Thursday from skew.com, shows, this past week was only the third highest week for liquidations so far in 2021, and it\u2019s the fourth time this year that bitcoin futures liquidations have crossed $4 billion in notional value. Offshore futures markets did not artificially flash-crash the price.\u00a0\n\nWednesday\u2019s bitcoin price drop was swifter and deeper than any so far this year. The CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX) low, struck in the wee hours UTC time at $30,037.61, was 54% off its all-time high, 41% off its price before Elon started tweeting and 30% off the prior day\u2019s closing price at midnight UTC.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s the third time this year bitcoin has entered \u201cbear market\u201d territory, by equity markets\u2019 rule of thumb, which is a 20% drop. The two prior occasions occurred as the XBX made its way to its current all-time high ($64,888.19, set on April 14). Some bear market.\n\nOn any time scale, a 30% intra-day drop is unusual for bitcoin. Matt Weller of forex.com presented this illustrative chart Wednesday afternoon on All About Bitcoin on CoinDesk TV.\u00a0\n\nThe chart shows how, in the bull market that began in the second half of 2015, bitcoin saw eight drawdowns of 30% or more. None of them took place in the course of a single 24-hour day. But they all took place during a longer upward trend that took bitcoin\u2019s price from $200 to $20,000.\n\nThe current bull market dates back to March 2020, when bitcoin hit a yearly low of $3,905. If this bull market grows to resemble that period, it will put bitcoin on course to hit the $400,000 mark by July 2022. That\u2019s a big if, but also a popular one.\n- Ray Dalio, Wall Street\u2019s \u2018Oddest Duck,\u2019 Shares the Bitcoin Mind\n- \u2018Grayscale Discount\u2019 Narrows to 10% and Could Shrink More as Lockups Expire\n"}, {"headline": "Stock market news live updates: Stocks log third straight day of losses as technology stocks slide", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Yahoo Finance", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/LOkwytjIRJzVmBpUe__YZQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/df099790-97d8-11eb-bffb-90dd619e59aa", "auther": "Emily McCormick", "body": "Stocks logged a third straight day of declines as inflation concerns persisted.\n\n[Click here to read what's moving markets heading into Thursday, May 20]\n\nThe Nasdaq underperformed, and the index opened lower by more than 1.5% before paring some losses.

However, some strategists said the pullback was to be expected given the strength of the run-up so far this year up until May, and noted it did not reflect a worsening in economic or company fundamentals.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe pullback here has gotten a little deeper over the last couple of trading sessions, not necessarily threatening technically important lines of support,\u201d Mark Luschini, Janney Montgomery Scott chief investment strategist, told Yahoo Finance. \"We bounced off [the lows] on an intraday basis today. We'll see if it holds or if we need to do a little bit more work on the downside to kind of flush out some of the sentiment that'd gotten perhaps a little bit overly exuberant relative to this advance that we've had earlier this year.\"\n\n\"In the context of the market, we're still up over 8% on a year-to-date basis. The economic conditions fundamentally are still very supportive for stock prices,\" he added. \"We had, once again, a little concern here recently on inflation. Obviously the big risk at the moment is that it's not so transitory in nature and that it persists at more elevated levels even as we lap the effects of a year ago. And that, the jury is still out on.\"\u00a0\n\n\u2014\n\nHere's where markets were trading as of 12:13 p.m. ET:\u00a0\n- S&P 500 (^GSPC): -33.55 points (-0.81%) to 4,094.28\n- Dow (^DJI): -323.71 points (-0.95%) to 33,736.95\n- Nasdaq (^IXIC): -85.51 points (-0.64%) to 13,218.65\u00a0\n- Crude (CL=F): -$2.47 (-3.77%) to $63.02 a barrel\n- Gold (GC=F): +$17.60 (+0.94%) to $1,885.60 per ounce\n- 10-year Treasury (^TNX): -0.7 bps to yield 1.635%\n\n\u2014\n\nMajor cryptocurrency platforms including Binance and Coinbase (COIN) experienced service disruptions as volatility in bitcoin (BTC-USD), ethereum (ETH-USD) and other cryptocurrencies skyrocketed Wednesday.\n\nCoinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S., wrote in a status update Wednesday morning that it was investigating delays in withdrawals for ethereum and ERC-20 tokens due to network congestion, and is experiencing intermittent downtime across the Coinbase platform.\n\n\"We\u2019re seeing some issues on Coinbase and Coinbase Pro and some features may not be functioning completely normal,\" a Coinbase spokesperson said in an email to Yahoo Finance. \"We\u2019re currently investigating these issues and will provide updates as soon as possible.\"\n\nBinance, the world's biggest crypto exchange, also announced temporary halts on ethereum and ERC-20 withdrawals. It added in a separate statement that it had temporarily suspended trading for all Binance Leveraged Tokens, with some exceptions including for BTCUP, BTCDOWN and ETHUP.\n\nShares of Coinbase fell to the lowest level since their direct listing last month, trading below $220 per share.

Last week Tesla (TSLA) boss Elon Musk said his business was abandoning plans to accept bitcoin as payment, citing environmental concerns.\n\nRead more: How bad is bitcoin for the environment?\n\nIn a blog post this week, the Ethereum Foundation \u2014 a non-profit that works to maintain the network underpinning the digital asset \u2014 said it would soon shift ethereum to a new infrastructure that would \"end the process of expending a country\u2019s worth of energy on consensus.\"\n\nDevelopers plan to shift ethereum from a \"proof of work\" system to a \"proof of stake\" system.\u00a0\n\nWatch: What are the risks of investing in cryptocurrency?\n\nUnder a proof of work system, computers around the world complete cryptographic maths equations to validate and secure transactions on the network. Solving these equations uses up huge amounts of electricity in the form of computing power. The vast power required stops one individual or group from being able to target the network and overpower it, theoretically allowing an entity to write in transactions sending themselves cryptocurrency.\u00a0\n\nUnder a proof of stake system, participants in the network simply have to prove they hold ethereum to contribute to its underlying operations. Computers \"stake\" their ethereum and in return can validate and secure transactions on the network. A majority of participants in the network must validate transactions for them to go through, which acts as a check against fraud.\n\nCarl Beekhuizen, a developer at the Ethereum Foundation, said in a blog that while there was no \"concrete statistics on energy consumption\" for ethereum, his \"ballpark\" estimates suggested the change in the infrastructure would reduce its energy usage by around 99.95%.\u00a0\n\nRead more: Bitcoin, ethereum and the blockchain technology behind decentralised finance\n\n\"A Proof-of-Stake Ethereum therefore consumes something on the order of 2.62 megawatt,\" Beekhuizen wrote. \"This is not on the scale of countries, provinces, or even cities, but that of a small town (around 2,100 American homes).\n\n\"For reference, Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus on Ethereum currently consumes the energy equivalent of a medium-sized country.\"\n\nAnalysts at Bank of America said in March that ethereum was estimated to be using the same amount of energy each year as Cuba.\n\nBeekhuizen said a proof of stake system would mean energy usage is uncorrelated with price. Under the current system, ethereum's energy usage rises and falls in line with its price.\n\nThe planned transition comes as cryptocurrencies face heightened scrutiny of their environmental impact. Elon Musk was forced to abandon plans for Tesla to accept bitcoin (BTC-USD) as payment, following a backlash linked to the cryptocurrency's environmental impact.\u00a0\n\nBitcoin also uses a proof of work model. Its underlying network uses more energy per year than Ukraine. Analysts at Bank of America said earlier this year that investors had to \"pay attention to the enormous environmental costs of Bitcoin\".\n\nRead more: Tesla's bitcoin investment has carbon footprint of 1.8 million cars\n\nBeekhuizen said ethereum's new infrastructure means each transaction should use the same amount of electricity as \"about 20 minutes of TV.\"\n\n\"By contrast, Ethereum PoW uses the equivalent energy of a house for 2.8 days per transaction and Bitcoin consumes 38 house-days worth,\" he wrote.\n\nThe changes will have major implications for the environmental impact of the broader cryptocurrency space. Ethereum is used as the infrastructure for many other cryptocurrency projects and so-called \"decentralized finance\" applications.\n\nShifting ethereum from proof of work to proof of stake has been planned for years but the plan has been beset by political and technical problems. Beekhuizen said the infrastructure was now up and running and being tested. The foundation hopes to complete the shift in the \"upcoming months\".\n\nBank of America analysts said earlier this year that the shift to proof of stake \"could reduce Ether's carbon footprint\" but warned it would \"increase both the social and governance risks of this crypto-currency.\"\n\nNews of the looming shift came as ethereum and other cryptocurrencies crashed to the lowest point in months. A broad sell-off hit the market on Wednesday, wiping out billions. Ethereum dropped as much as 40% on the day before recovering on Thursday.\n\nWatch: How to prevent getting into debt\n"}, {"headline": "Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies plunge on Elon Musk tweets", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Yahoo Finance UK", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/zIhIwSoKQ4ttQenOA18vrA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/89564dc0-b6e6-11eb-aff5-f9e47e3115fb", "auther": "LaToya Harding", "body": "The price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) crashed to its lowest level since the end of February after Elon Musk sparked concern that Tesla (TSLA) could sell its holdings of the cryptocurrency.\n\nLast night a Twitter account called CryptoWhale tweeted: \u201cBitcoiners are going to slap themselves next quarter when they find out Tesla dumped the rest of their holdings.

However, many made strong recoveries on the day and stocks rallied off the lows. Let\u2019s look at a few top stock trades for Thursday.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nEthereum (CCC:ETH-USD) had been on a powerful rally not that long ago. However, it\u2019s been under pressure since topping out earlier this month and then finally broke down on Wednesday.\n\nAt the session low, Ethereum was down 37% today! However, from the lows, it\u2019s actually up 40%, curbing its one-day losses to \u201cjust\u201d 23% at the moment. The volatility has been wild, to say the least.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNow back above the 50-day and 10-week moving averages, bulls need to see Ethereum hold above these measures. At the very least, it has to hold above $2,550.\n\nIf ETH loses the $2,500 mark, we can\u2019t rule out a return to this week\u2019s low. Luckily, shares caught a bounce right where we had the breakout marked, near $2,000.\n-  7 High Quality Industrial Stocks to Buy Now \n\nOn the upside, however, let\u2019s see how Ethereum does on a test of its 10-day moving average. Above it could put the $3,500 mark and the 21-day moving average in play.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has been range bound since last summer, although $74 continues to hold as support.\n\nOn the upside, we want to see a rally back to $80, where AMD stock will find its 10-week and 50-week moving averages. Above these measures puts the 21-week on the table, followed by resistance at $88.\n\nOn a break below last week\u2019s low at $72.50, it\u2019s possible we see a move lower. In that scenario, keep an eye on the 21-month moving average. If for some reason AMD stock breaks below that measure, the $60 breakout level could be in play.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nWhile other retailers have struggled despite strong earnings results, Target (NYSE:TGT) is doing quite well.\n\nShares are pushing higher on Wednesday, running into its prior highs. From here I\u2019d love to see a push up to the 161.8% extension near $220. Above that puts the two-times range extension at $233 in play.\n-  7 Blue-Chip Stocks Looking Better Than Ever \n\nOn the downside, though, keep an eye on $210. Losing that mark likely puts it below the 10-day and 21-day moving averages, and puts the 10-week and 50-day moving averages on the table. For now, bulls are in control with this one.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nUnlike Target, TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) is not responding well to earnings. However, that\u2019s not the end of the world, either.\n\nShares are trading right down into the 21-week moving average, a measure that has been support all year. If it holds, look to see if TJX stock can reclaim the 10-week.\n\nIf it fails to do so, it\u2019s possible we see a retest of the pre-coronavirus highs near $65, with more support sitting in the low $60s.\n\nBack above $71, and TJX stock could retest the all-time highs.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\n\nJD.com (NASDAQ:JD) was trading really well coming into 2021, but like other growth stocks, it has struggled mightily since topping out in mid-February.\n\nAfter cascading lower, JD stock quickly saw its short-term moving averages turn from support to resistance, while it failed to reclaim $85. This combination should have kept bulls out of the name.\n\nThen it failed to hold the $78 to $79 area and 50-week moving average, which also turned to resistance. Are you sensing a pattern?\n\nNow trying to hold last week\u2019s low near $66.50, let\u2019s navigate this one. On the upside, see how JD stock does on a retest of the $77 to $80 area, if it can get there.

It is now around 45% below record highs reached earlier in the year. The cryptocurrency remains up 15% since the start of the year, following a spectacular rally that began last October.\n\nBitcoin's run-up was initially fuelled by the embrace of mainstream institutions. Banks, payment companies like Square (SQ) and PayPal (PYPL), and tech businesses such as Tesla or MicroStrategy (MSTR) all announced they were either working with or investing in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. MicroStrategy has put over $2bn into bitcoin and this week invested another $10m into buying into the price dip.

The answer is, for those watching closely, it likely strengthened it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s why: bitcoin proved itself on Wednesday when it saw its second biggest volume day of the year, and market infrastructure did not break. Some exchanges suffered outages, but liquidity was available, as spot volumes show. Moreover, while a drop of over 30% may be dizzying for new buyers high on hopium, such events are not uncommon in bitcoin\u2019s bull-market history.\n\nThe chart above shows bitcoin-dollar volume on the 11 exchanges that are eligible as components of the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX). That means these markets are accessible to U.S. investors, have transparent ownership and do not place limits on bitcoin or dollar withdrawals, among other criteria.\u00a0\n\nRelated: CME Returns to Second Place in Latest Rankings of Bitcoin Futures Exchanges\n\nThe chart shows how the May 19 selloff compared, in bitcoin terms, to volume traded in the Jan. 10 selloff, as Dogecoin and GameStop mania peaked on Jan. 22, and during a second sell-off in February.\n\nThe bitcoin-dollar markets in general are useful to watch, because they can indicate activity at a well-known market entry point \u2013 a place where new entrants \u201cbuying the dip\u201d are likely to place orders.\u00a0\n\nMore narrowly, XBX eligibility means these exchanges can attract institutional activity as well. In particular, LMAX Digital serves institutional clients exclusively, and Coinbase (marked here as Coinbase Pro) volume is 64% institutional, according to the company\u2019s latest earnings report.\n\n(To get insights like this in your inbox every Monday,\u00a0sign up for CoinDesk Indexes\u2019 weekly newsletter, \u201cThe Hard Fork\u201d.)\n\nRelated: Market Wrap: China Breaks Crypto as Bitcoin Falls to $36K, ETH Drops $300 in Two Hours\n\nCoinbase specifically set records on Wednesday, handling over $4 billion in notional BTC/USD volume for the first time. (It was not a record in bitcoin units. That record was set Dec. 13 2015, when 165,543 BTC changed hands on Coinbase dollar markets. For context, December 2015 saw bitcoin trading up into the $400s, four months into a bull market that would last through December 2017.) Coinbase ETH/USD markets also handled record volume in both ETH and dollar terms on Wednesday, 1.7 million ETH valued in aggregate at $4.5 billion.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe fact that spot market volume can crescendo like this is an indicator of market maturity, at least in these two blue-chip cryptocurrencies: capital is able to flow in as the price drops, and sellers are finding buyers on the way down.\u00a0\n\nMeanwhile, in offshore derivatives markets, all was normal. Wednesday put this week over $4 billion in bitcoin futures liquidations.\u00a0\n\nAs this chart, pulled Thursday from skew.com, shows, this past week was only the third highest week for liquidations so far in 2021, and it\u2019s the fourth time this year that bitcoin futures liquidations have crossed $4 billion in notional value. Offshore futures markets did not artificially flash-crash the price.\u00a0\n\nWednesday\u2019s bitcoin price drop was swifter and deeper than any so far this year. The CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX) low, struck in the wee hours UTC time at $30,037.61, was 54% off its all-time high, 41% off its price before Elon started tweeting and 30% off the prior day\u2019s closing price at midnight UTC.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s the third time this year bitcoin has entered \u201cbear market\u201d territory, by equity markets\u2019 rule of thumb, which is a 20% drop. The two prior occasions occurred as the XBX made its way to its current all-time high ($64,888.19, set on April 14). Some bear market.\n\nOn any time scale, a 30% intra-day drop is unusual for bitcoin. Matt Weller of forex.com presented this illustrative chart Wednesday afternoon on All About Bitcoin on CoinDesk TV.\u00a0\n\nThe chart shows how, in the bull market that began in the second half of 2015, bitcoin saw eight drawdowns of 30% or more. None of them took place in the course of a single 24-hour day. But they all took place during a longer upward trend that took bitcoin\u2019s price from $200 to $20,000.\n\nThe current bull market dates back to March 2020, when bitcoin hit a yearly low of $3,905. If this bull market grows to resemble that period, it will put bitcoin on course to hit the $400,000 mark by July 2022.

Cryptocurrencies sold off, with bitcoin (BTC-USD) sinking more than 17% to trade below $38,000, or the lowest level since February, and ethereum (ETH-USD) plunging 21% to below $3,800. The moves lower extended a recent bout of volatility and were exacerbated after the People's Bank of China doubled down on its stance that cryptocurrencies could not be used for payments. \n\nLeadership in equity markets has see-sawed between cyclical and value stocks and technology shares, as investors consider prospects for a strong economic rebound, but also the possibility that the pick-up in activity generates a surge in inflation that ultimately weighs on the recovery. So far this month, those concerns have won out and dragged on the indexes, with the S&P 500 down 1.3% for May-to-date and the Nasdaq down 4.7%.\u00a0\n\n\"We've been telling our clients that we're probably entering a period where there's going to be increased chop going forward,\" Matt Orton, Carillon Tower Advisors, told Yahoo Finance. \"We've had a pretty extreme rotation from growth into value.

The economy is starting to accelerate as we reopen. So there's a lot of reasons to continue owning equities, and it's all about having a game plan.\"\u00a0\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal Reserve released its April meeting minutes Wednesday afternoon, showing that \"participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee\u2019s maximum-employment and price-stability goals,\" and suggesting that they did not believe a near-term adjustment to monetary policy was not imminent. However, the minutes covered the Federal Open Market Committee's meeting from before the release of the much weaker-than-expected April jobs report and government print showing a much greater-than-expected increase in consumer prices, rendering them somewhat outdated.\u00a0\n\n\u2014\n\nHere were the main moves in markets as of 4:03 p.m. ET:\n- S&P 500 (^GSPC): -12.04 (-0.29%) to 4,115.79\n- Dow (^DJI): -163.17 (-0.48%) to 33,897.49\n- Nasdaq (^IXIC): -3.90 (-0.03%) to 13,299.74\n- Crude (CL=F): -$2.17 (-3.31%) to $63.32 a barrel\n- Gold (GC=F): +$3.60 (+0.19%) to $1,871.60 per ounce\n- 10-year Treasury (^TNX): +4.1 bps to yield 1.6830%\n\n\u2014\n\nThe Federal Reserve's April meeting minutes Wednesday afternoon reinforced that most Federal Open Market Committee members did not think QE tapering or rate increases were needed in the near-term, given the distance the economy still needs to make up to reach the Fed's employment and price stability goals.\u00a0\n\n\"Participants observed that economic activity had picked up sharply this year, with robust gains in consumer spending, housing-sector activity, business equipment investment, and manufacturing production,\" according to the minutes. \"They noted that the acceleration in economic activity reflected positive developments associated with the rapid pace of vaccinations as well as continued support from fiscal and monetary policies.

However, some strategists said the pullback was to be expected given the strength of the run-up so far this year up until May, and noted it did not reflect a worsening in economic or company fundamentals.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe pullback here has gotten a little deeper over the last couple of trading sessions, not necessarily threatening technically important lines of support,\u201d Mark Luschini, Janney Montgomery Scott chief investment strategist, told Yahoo Finance. \"We bounced off [the lows] on an intraday basis today. We'll see if it holds or if we need to do a little bit more work on the downside to kind of flush out some of the sentiment that'd gotten perhaps a little bit overly exuberant relative to this advance that we've had earlier this year.\"\n\n\"In the context of the market, we're still up over 8% on a year-to-date basis. The economic conditions fundamentally are still very supportive for stock prices,\" he added. \"We had, once again, a little concern here recently on inflation.

Comparable digital sales grew more than 50%, and digital sales comprised nearly one-fifth of all sales during the quarter. Gross margins of 30% and adjusted earnings per share of $3.69 each exceeded estimates.\u00a0\n\nFor the second quarter, Target sees mid-to-high single digit comparable sales growth.

Last week Tesla (TSLA) boss Elon Musk said his business was abandoning plans to accept bitcoin as payment, citing environmental concerns.\n\nRead more: How bad is bitcoin for the environment?\n\nIn a blog post this week, the Ethereum Foundation \u2014 a non-profit that works to maintain the network underpinning the digital asset \u2014 said it would soon shift ethereum to a new infrastructure that would \"end the process of expending a country\u2019s worth of energy on consensus.\"\n\nDevelopers plan to shift ethereum from a \"proof of work\" system to a \"proof of stake\" system.\u00a0\n\nWatch: What are the risks of investing in cryptocurrency?\n\nUnder a proof of work system, computers around the world complete cryptographic maths equations to validate and secure transactions on the network. Solving these equations uses up huge amounts of electricity in the form of computing power. The vast power required stops one individual or group from being able to target the network and overpower it, theoretically allowing an entity to write in transactions sending themselves cryptocurrency.\u00a0\n\nUnder a proof of stake system, participants in the network simply have to prove they hold ethereum to contribute to its underlying operations. Computers \"stake\" their ethereum and in return can validate and secure transactions on the network. A majority of participants in the network must validate transactions for them to go through, which acts as a check against fraud.\n\nCarl Beekhuizen, a developer at the Ethereum Foundation, said in a blog that while there was no \"concrete statistics on energy consumption\" for ethereum, his \"ballpark\" estimates suggested the change in the infrastructure would reduce its energy usage by around 99.95%.\u00a0\n\nRead more: Bitcoin, ethereum and the blockchain technology behind decentralised finance\n\n\"A Proof-of-Stake Ethereum therefore consumes something on the order of 2.62 megawatt,\" Beekhuizen wrote. \"This is not on the scale of countries, provinces, or even cities, but that of a small town (around 2,100 American homes).\n\n\"For reference, Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus on Ethereum currently consumes the energy equivalent of a medium-sized country.\"\n\nAnalysts at Bank of America said in March that ethereum was estimated to be using the same amount of energy each year as Cuba.\n\nBeekhuizen said a proof of stake system would mean energy usage is uncorrelated with price. Under the current system, ethereum's energy usage rises and falls in line with its price.\n\nThe planned transition comes as cryptocurrencies face heightened scrutiny of their environmental impact. Elon Musk was forced to abandon plans for Tesla to accept bitcoin (BTC-USD) as payment, following a backlash linked to the cryptocurrency's environmental impact.\u00a0\n\nBitcoin also uses a proof of work model. Its underlying network uses more energy per year than Ukraine. Analysts at Bank of America said earlier this year that investors had to \"pay attention to the enormous environmental costs of Bitcoin\".\n\nRead more: Tesla's bitcoin investment has carbon footprint of 1.8 million cars\n\nBeekhuizen said ethereum's new infrastructure means each transaction should use the same amount of electricity as \"about 20 minutes of TV.\"\n\n\"By contrast, Ethereum PoW uses the equivalent energy of a house for 2.8 days per transaction and Bitcoin consumes 38 house-days worth,\" he wrote.\n\nThe changes will have major implications for the environmental impact of the broader cryptocurrency space. Ethereum is used as the infrastructure for many other cryptocurrency projects and so-called \"decentralized finance\" applications.\n\nShifting ethereum from proof of work to proof of stake has been planned for years but the plan has been beset by political and technical problems. Beekhuizen said the infrastructure was now up and running and being tested. The foundation hopes to complete the shift in the \"upcoming months\".\n\nBank of America analysts said earlier this year that the shift to proof of stake \"could reduce Ether's carbon footprint\" but warned it would \"increase both the social and governance risks of this crypto-currency.\"\n\nNews of the looming shift came as ethereum and other cryptocurrencies crashed to the lowest point in months. A broad sell-off hit the market on Wednesday, wiping out billions. Ethereum dropped as much as 40% on the day before recovering on Thursday.\n\nWatch: How to prevent getting into debt\n"}, {"headline": "Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies plunge on Elon Musk tweets", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Yahoo Finance UK", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/zIhIwSoKQ4ttQenOA18vrA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/89564dc0-b6e6-11eb-aff5-f9e47e3115fb", "auther": "LaToya Harding", "body": "The price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) crashed to its lowest level since the end of February after Elon Musk sparked concern that Tesla (TSLA) could sell its holdings of the cryptocurrency.\n\nLast night a Twitter account called CryptoWhale tweeted: \u201cBitcoiners are going to slap themselves next quarter when they find out Tesla dumped the rest of their holdings.
