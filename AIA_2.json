[{"headline": "Focus Might Turns to Euro Selling While Dollar Rally Capped by Strong Risk Appetite", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Action Forex", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://www.actionforex.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/f-eur9-e1600272705134.jpg", "author": [], "body": "Dollar ended as the strongest one last week but Friday\u2019s steel fall after solid non-farm payroll job reports suggests that it\u2019s rally is already losing steam. It\u2019s still a bit early to call a bearish reversal for the greenback. Yet, strong risk-on sentiments could cap Dollar\u2019s upside attempts ahead, and even trigger a deeper pull back.\n\nEuro ended as the second weakest, next to Aussie, but the late development in EUR/AUD suggests that the favor is not on Euro\u2019s side. More importantly, developments in some crosses like EUR/CHF and EUR/CAD indicates that market focuses might turn to selling in Euro in crosses ahead. On the other hand, the late rebound in Canadian Dollar opens up some upside prospects for the near term.\n\nNASDAQ closed at new record, heading to 15k handle\n\nNASDAQ\u2019s up trend continued last wee after some hesitation, and finished with a strong close at new record high of 14639.32. Near term outlook will remain bullish as long as 14439.90 supports. Next target is 61.8% projection of 10822.57 to 14175.11 from 13002.53 at 15074.39.\n\nThat would be an important level to overcome as it\u2019s firstly close to 15k handle. More importantly, a strong break of 15k could put weekly MACD back into a rising track. That would in turn argues that NASDAQ is back in medium term up side acceleration. Strong break of 15k would set the stage for even more powerful rise in this 2H of the year.\n\nDOW to catch to resume record run.\n\nDOW also made some notable progress even though it\u2019s still lagging behind S&P 500 and NASDAQ. Current development argues that consolidation pattern from 35091.56 has already completed at 33271.93, after brief breach of medium term channel support.\n\nDOW could take on 35091.56 record high this week, and break will confirm resumption of larger up trend from 18213.65. Next target would be 100% projection of 18213.65 to 2919935 from 26143.77 at 37129.47.\n\nDollar index failed to extend rally, but more upside still mildly in favor\n\nDollar\u2019s development was rather disappointing, as it reacted more to strong risk-on sentiments much more than the solid NFP report. It\u2019s still too early to call an end to the rise from 89.53 as long as 91.51 support holds. Further rally would still be seen to 93.43 resistance and possibly above.\n\nBut we\u2019d maintain that rise from 89.53 is seen as the third leg of the consolidation pattern from 89.20. Hence, we\u2019d expect strong resistance from 38.2% retracement of 102.99 to 89.20 at 94.46 at 94.46. to limit upside, at least to extend sideway trading. Break of 91.51 will suggest that such rise has completed prematurely, and bring retest of 89.20/53 support zone.\n\nEUR/CHF and EUR/CAD turn weaker, more downside ahead\n\nEuro turned notably weaker in some crosses last week. In particular, EUR/CHF\u2019s break of 1.0939 support argues that rebound from 1.0863 has completed at 1.0985 already. It\u2019s also kept below medium term channel resistance, and struggled to sustain above 55 day EMA. The development argues that choppy decline from 1.1149 is still in progress.\n\nDeeper fall is not in favor for the near term to retest 1.0863 support first. Break will resume the fall from 1.1149 to cluster support level at 1.0737, 61.8% retracement of 1.0505 to 1.1149 at 1.0751.\n\nEUR/CAD also dropped notably on Friday and deeper fall is now in favor this week to retest 1.4580 support. The failure to sustain above falling 55 day EMA keeps near term outlook bearish. Break of 1.14580 will confirm resumption of larger decline from 1.5978 and target 61.8% projection of 1.5783 to 1.4723 from 1.5191 at 1.4536. Firm break there could bring further downside acceleration to 1.4263 long term support next.\n\nCanadian Dollar has some upside prospect ahead\n\nOn the other hand, Canadian Dollar has the prospect of turning stronger, with help from persistently strong oil price, BoC tapering expectation. But that would be subject to the upcoming employment data this week. Anyway, AUD/CAD\u2019s breach of 0.9258 support argues that larger fall from 0.9991 is resuming. Focus is back on 0.9247 key cluster support level (38.2% retracement of 0.8058 to 0.9991 at 0.9253).\n\nSustained break of 0.9247/53 will bring some downside re-acceleration to 61.8% projection of 0.9757 to 0.9258 from 0.9394 at 0.9086. There is prospect of even deeper fall to 61.8% retracement of 0.8058 to 0.9991 at 0.8796. Strong rebound from current level, followed by break of 0.9394 resistance will suggest short term bottoming, and bring turn the fortune between Aussie and Loonie.\n\nAUD/USD Weekly Outlook\n\nAUD/USD edged lower to 0.7443 last week but quickly recovered again. Initial bias is turned neutral this week first. Another fall could still be seen, and break of 0.7443 will resume the whole corrective pattern from 0.8006. But we\u2019d expect strong support from 100% projection of 0.8006 to 0.7530 from 0.7890 at 0.7414 to bring rebound. On the upside, break of 0.7615 resistance will indicate short term bottoming, on bearish divergence condition in 4 hour MACD. Intraday bias will be turned back to the upside for 0.7890/8006 resistance zone.\n\nIn the bigger picture, rise from 0.5506 medium term bottom could either be the start of a long term up trend, or a corrective rise. Reactions to 0.8135 key resistance will reveal which case it is. Rejection by 0.8135 key resistance, followed by firm break of 0.7413 resistance turned support, will favors the latter case. Deeper decline would be seen to 38.2% retracement of 0.5506 to 0.8006 at 0.7051 first.\n\nIn the longer term picture, 0.5506 is a long term bottom, on bullish convergence condition in monthly MACD. Focus is now back on 0.8135 structural resistance. Decisive break there will raise the chance that rise from 0.5506 is an impulsive up trend. Next target should be 61.8% retracement at 0.8950 of 1.1079 to 0.5506 and above. Though, rejection by 0.8135 will keep the case of medium to long term sideway consolidation open."}, {"headline": "AUD/CAD May Be a Catch-Up Trade in Q3: Q3 Top Trading Opportunities", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "DailyFX", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://a.c-dn.net/b/0TRbKm/headline_Generic_1.jpg", "author": ["Justin Mcqueen"], "body": "Coming in to Q2 my trade of short AUD/CAD had been predicated on US exceptionalism and the growing divergence between the BoC and RBA. While the US exceptionalism narrative dissipated, the theme of diverging monetary policy continues to bear watching. The divergence emerged was after the BoC tapered QE, while also signalling a rate increase for H2 2022. In contrast RBA signalled no rate increase before 2024. In Q3 AUD/CAD may be a catch up trade with BoC tightening priced into the currency, while strong Aussie data (employment in particular) may see the RBA to bring forward rate hike expectations.\n\nMeanwhile my view is that USD will head higher from current levels. The consensus trade for arguably the past year has been to short the USD as evidenced by CFTC data showing the build-up in net short positions. However, the FOMC\u2019s hawkish pivot in which the dot plot projections now see two rate hikes in 2023 from zero, suggests that the central bank\u2019s reaction function has changed with FOMC less willing to allow the economy to run hot. Under these conditions, economic data will matter more and spur heightened volatility on data releases.\n\nOn the monetary policy front, the main dates to focus are the Jackson Hole Symposium (marks one year since the launch of AIT) and the September monetary policy meeting. Given the sizeable net short USD positioning, an unwind can provide fuel for a more prolonged rise as we head towards a Q3 taper signal. To add to this, an increase in \u201cdemise of the dollar\u201d reporting late in Q2 coincided with the greenback\u2019s low point, which could suggest that the pain trade would be for a more persistent rise in the USD.\n\nUSD Chart: Daily Time Frame"}, {"headline": "Asian Open: The US Dollar Sits Tall Ahead of Nonfarm Payrolls", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "City Index", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://www.cityindex.co.uk/~/media/research/global/news-analysis/featured-image/jobs-2.jpg", "author": ["Stonex Financial Ltd", "Matt Simpson"], "body": "Asian Futures:\n\nAustralia's ASX 200 futures flat (0%), the cash market is currently estimated to open at 7,265.60\n\nJapan's Nikkei 225 futures are up 120 points (0.42%), the cash market is currently estimated to open at 28,827.04\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng futures are up 18 points (0.06%), the cash market is currently estimated to open at 28,845.95\n\nUK and Europe:\n\nUK's FTSE 100 index rose 87.69 points (1.25%) to close at 7,125.16\n\nEurope's Euro STOXX 50 index rose 14.59 points (0.36%) to close at 4,078.89\n\nGermany's DAX index rose 72.77 points (0.47%) to close at 15,603.81\n\nFrance's CAC 40 index rose 45.99 points (0.71%) to close at 6,553.82\n\nThursday US Close:\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial rose 131.02 points (0.38%) to close at 34,633.53\n\nThe S&P 500 index rose 22.44 points (0.53%) to close at 4,319.94\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 index rose 5.252 points (0.04%) to close at 14,560.05\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn how to trade indices\n\n\n\n\n\nIndices: S&P hits record high for 6th straight day\n\nAnother day, another set of strong employment data and record highs for the US stock market.

But, taken alongside strong ADP beating expectations earlier this week (even if softer than the prior read), it\u2019s not a bad set of data overall ahead of today\u2019s NFP report. But, as Matt Weller points out, some leading indicators point towards a weaker-than expected NFP today which could lead to another disappointment for the highly anticipated release (and take the wind out of sentiment just before the weekend).\n\nThe S&P 500 hit a record high for a sixth consecutive session and rose 0.5%, led by energy, utility and financial sectors. Consumer staples was the only sector to close in the red. Nasdaq biotech stocks rose 1.16%, banking stocks were up 1.06% although the Nasdaq 100 was only up by 0.04%. FAANGS were down slightly at -0.05%.\n\n\n\n\n\nASX 200 Market Internals:\n\n\n\n\n\nASX 200: 7265.6 (-0.65%), 30 July 2021\n\nMaterials (0.08%) was the strongest sector and Consumer Discretionary (-1.3%) was the weakest\n\n9 out of the 11 sectors closed lower\n\n59 (29.65%) stocks advanced, 134 (67.34%) stocks declined\n\n9 hit a new 52-week high, 2 hit a new 52-week low\n\n71.36% of stocks closed above their 200-day average\n\n60.3% of stocks closed above their 50-day average\n\n46.23% of stocks closed above their 20-day average\n\nOutperformers:\n\n+ 8.05% - Regis Resources Ltd (RRL.AX)\n\n+ 5.57% - St Barbara Ltd (SBM.AX)\n\n+ 5.43% - Nuix Ltd (NXL.AX)\n\nUnderperformers:\n\n-5.93% - Chalice Mining Ltd (CHN.AX)\n\n-4.92% - Iluka Resources Ltd (ILU.AX)\n\n-4.51% - Metcash Ltd (MTS.AX)\n\n\n\n\n\nForex: USD retains extends its lead, BOE Bailey send GBP lower\n\nThe US dollar index (DXY) rose to a three-month high of 92.630 overnight as economic data hinted towards a strong NFP print, in turn bring expectations of a hike sooner than the Fed are currently making out. Let\u2019s hope NFP excels to live up to bullish expectation, or else gains be quickly lost.\n\nUSD/JPY reached our first target in the European session and second target in the US and is now trading slightly lower around 111.50. Its next major resistance levels to conquer are the pandemic and highs at 111.71 and 112.22 (with 112.00 thrown in due to being a round number, of course). If today\u2019s NFP data comes in strong enough it could reach 112.0 quite easily and possibly even 12.22. But, if it disappoints once again, we\u2019d expect prices to close firmly beneath the March 2020 high of 111.70 this week and roll over. Therefore, the March 2020 high is a pivotal level around today\u2019s FP report in our view.\n\nThe British pound was the weakest currency BOE\u2019s governor Andrew Bailey after saying it was important to not overact (ie. raise rates) to rising inflation. GBP/USD broken beneath key support of 1.3784 to an 11-week low and EUR/GBP rose 0.43% to print a bearish outside candle. Incidentally, GBP/USD was the weakest pair and EUR/GBP was the strongest.\n\nAUD/USD fell to its lowest level this year before finding support at the December 1st low It very much remains in the hands of today\u2019s NFP report. AUD/CAD warrants a look as it has formed a bullish hammer at the June low (and just above its October low). Granted, its not the prettiest of trades but there is potential for a counter-trend bounce, particularly if Canada\u2019s PMI data, building permits and trade balance data disappoints at 1:30pm tonight.\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn how to trade forex\n\n\n\n\n\nCommodities: OPEC+ send oil prices higher\n\nGold prices rallied for a second day and rose around 0.3%, which is not bad given the strength of the US dollar. We had tipped out hat to gold\u2019s potential to rise yesterday although it didn\u2019t quite reach our lower target of 1785. Still, with real-rates (represented by TIPS) continuing to fall, perhaps there\u2019s till room for gold to rise from here.\n\nThe OPEC+ meeting sent oil prices higher after indicating they would increase production at a slower rate than expected. WTI rose 2.4% to 75.23 and brent rallied 0.53% to settle at 75.53.\n\n\n\n\n\nUp Next (Times in AEST)\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can view all the scheduled events for today using our economic calendar, and keep up to date with the latest market news and analysis here.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to trade with City Index\n\nFollow these easy steps to start trading with City Index today:"}, {"headline": "Top 10 Online Forex Brokers in 2021", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Economy Watch", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://www.economywatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/eToro-3-1024x598.png", "author": [], "body": "If you are interested in forex trading and want to make a career out of it, the first thing you need to do is look for a reputable and reliable broker.

In the course of buying and selling cryptocurrencies, a forex broker is typically a financial service company that acts as an intermediary between the trader and the interbank system. While making a transaction between a pair of currencies that are generally made of the ten most traded and liquid currencies including USD, EUR, AUD, and others, traders can initiate and execute a trade using a forex broker and earn profit depending on the current exchange rate.\n\nHow Do Forex Brokers Work?\n\nThe forex broker typically works as an intermediary between you and the interbank system, which is a network of banks that trade with each other daily. The broker will typically offer you a price from the banks and financial institutions through which they have access to forex liquidity.\n\nWhen you start trading with a forex broker and open your first trade, the broker will pass it through the market. They offer you a price for that particular forex pair, typically shown in quote form such as GBP/USD 1.3500/1.3505. Here, the first number is the rate the broker offers you if you want to sell the pair. The second number shows the rate at which you can buy the pair. The difference between the numbers i.e., .0005 or 5 pips is taken as a commission by the broker and is known as the spread.\n\nA broker will typically provide you with a trading platform, which is a software program that can either be downloaded or used via a browser on the web. This is the main platform where you buy and sell currencies, monitor trades, conduct technical analysis, and all related functions of trading. Once the broker executes your order, it can either be a winning or a losing trade, leading to a profit or loss for your trading account.\n\nBest UK Forex Brokers \u2013 Top 10 Reviewed\n\n1. eToro \u2013 Best of the Best Forex Brokers\n\nFounded in 2007, eToro is one of the leading forex brokers worldwide.

The broker should be regulated by a major international regulatory body.\n\nDo\u2019s and Don\u2019t\u2019s\n\nPicking the right forex broker will certainly nudge you in the right direction. However, success in the forex market also depends on your actions. You should thus know what to do and what not to do to minimise losses and maximise profits.\n\nDo:\n\nDevelop a concrete plan: You should always try to develop a concrete plan before you dive into the market. Evaluate your goals and objectives before you cast your first trade. Entering the market without a plan can have disastrous consequences, especially if one trades impulsively.\n\nAlways use stop loss and take profit: It\u2019s always important to sit down and evaluate the amount of profit that you feel is realistically achievable. This extends to the use of stop-loss and take-profit levels. Failure to choose fixed levels for closing your trading position will result in closing trades based on emotion.\n\nResearching the market: Staying on top of the factors that affect the forex market. This can extend to international politics, news regarding financial regulations, and other factors such as wars and natural disasters. Typically you would want to get real-time information on factors that affect the currency pair you\u2019re trading, such as the country\u2019s inflation rates and other economic markers.\n\nDon\u2019t:\n\nDon\u2019t commit money you can\u2019t afford to lose: There is a fine line between trading cautiously and outright gambling. So you should always stay within the budget parameters set. It is very easy to get carried away and end up investing more money than you originally planned in forex trading.\n\nDon\u2019t commit revenge trading: Revenge trading is when you try to make up for losses incurred earlier in the day by impulsively executing trades. Do not fall for this trap as you will end up trading using raw emotion rather than trading rules, leading to more losses. You should rather use take-profit levels to lock your gains once you reach your profit target levels. This will alleviate the temptation for further gains.\n\nDon\u2019t let emotions take over: Human emotions such as greed and fear can lead to impractical trading decisions where you will end up incurring a loss. For instance, fear can lead to traders closing their positions early missing out on profits. Always remember that you should stick to your set plan and exit the market once your target profit level for the day has been achieved.\n\nHow to Begin Trading With Forex Brokers \u2013 eToro Guide\n\n\n\nOnce you have made up your mind about which forex broker to use for trading your preferred forex pairs then all that is left to do is start trading.

Furthermore, consumer\u2019s outlook on whether jobs are \u2018plentiful\u2019 over \u2018hard to get\u2019 rose to its highest differential since 2000, which could bode well for Friday\u2019s NFP report if that indeed turns out to be the current situation.\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 extended their record highs, with the S&P 500 extending its record for a fourth consecutive session. Yet volatility was low overall with the S&P and Dow Jones rising just 0.3% and the Nasdaq rose 0.33%.\n\nIn Europe equities had a positive start yet failed to hold onto early gains to close effectively flat. The FTSE 100 and CAC printed bearish hammers inside Monday\u2019s bearish ranges, so we are still on guard for a bearish break on the FTSE of Monday\u2019s low.\n\nThe ASX 200 threw a spanner in the works of the symmetrical triangle discussed yesterday, by teasing bears with a downside break yet recovering later in the session to close flat with a bullish pinbar. Considering this is as 10 million Australian\u2019s went into lockdown then it\u2019s not a bad close at all.

Commodity currencies were the weakest majors overnight and the weakest month-to-date.\n\nThe Japanese yen was the strongest major as the risk-off sentiment apparent in yesterday\u2019s Asian session spilled over to the European and US ones. The yen was up against all its major peers but made the most ground against the Australian dollar as several states have headed back into lockdown and the Delta variant rose across parts of Asia. AUD/JPY was the biggest mover, shedding -0.8% in line with our bearish bias and its ranges topping near its 10-day ATR and hitting the initial target of 0.8300. Its next support level is 82.76. Strong economic sentiment for Europe lifted EUR/AUD to our near-term bullish target at its 200-day eMA.\n\nThe US dollar index (DXY) moved higher in line with its double bottom breakout, rose to a six-day high and made it around \u00be of its way to the double bottom target at 92.30. USD/CHF stopped just shy of our June high target and GBP/USD came just 14 pips from our initial 1.3800 target. AUD/USD and NZD/USD both closed firmly beneath their 200-day eMA\u2019s after printing prominent highs.\n\n\n\n\n\nUSD/JPY was just -0.1% lower by the close but intraday price action suggests the move to be corrective. Its trend remains bullish overall, and prices are accelerating away from trendline support to show a pickup of momentum. Prices have also retraced for four consecutive days since last week\u2019s high. Moreover, prices have formed a Doji and respected a cluster of support including the monthly R1 and pivot and weekly pivot point and 20-day eMA. Therefore, if prices can break above yesterday\u2019s high without breaking the support zone then bulls could assume momentum is trying to realign with its bullish trend.\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn how to trade forex\n\n\n\n\n\nCommodities: Metals feel the weight of a stronger dollar\n\nGold and silver finally woke up from their small but choppy sideways ranges with downside breaks.

Silver fell -1.26% and probed the 25.56 low before closing at 25.73.\n\nPlatinum futures fell -3% and accelerated further away from its 200-day eMA after printing a two-bar bearish reversal at the technical milestone on Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUp Next (Times in AEST)\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can view all the scheduled events for today using our economic calendar, and keep up to date with the latest market news and analysis here."}, {"headline": "Exchange rates predict exchange rates: GBP/USD, USD/CAD, EUR/JPY", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "FXStreet", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://editorial.fxstreet.com/images/Markets/Currencies/Majors/GBPUSD/iStock-1088749732_Large.jpg", "author": [], "body": "GBP/USD Vs USD/CAD contained nearly a 2000 pip spread and nonnormal.

Trading conditions will be thin with liquidity at a premium. The release of the US Payrolls report on Friday is huge in the light of recent US inflation data (CPI, PCE). All forecasts from ACY\u2019s Finlogix, unless specified. Today kicks off with Japan\u2019s May Unemployment Rate (Finlogix forecast: 2.9% from 2.8 % m/m). Japan\u2019s May Job Application Ratio (monthly job openings) follows next (f/c 1.08 from previous 1.09). Japan also reports on its May Retail Sales (y/y forecast 7.9% from previous 12%). Europe starts off with France\u2019s Q1 Unemployment Rate (Q4 2020 was 8%, no forecasts given). French Consumer Confidence for June follows (f/c 100 from previous 97). UK reports on its June Nationwide House Prices (m/m f/c 0.7% from 1.8%, y/y f/c 13.7% from 10.9%). UK Net Lending to Individuals for May follows (m/m f/c GBP 4.6 billion from GBP 2.9 billion). UK May Mortgage Approvals follow (f/c 85.34k from 86.9k). Eurozone Consumer Confidence for June follows (f/c -3.3 from -5.1). Germany releases its June Preliminary Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (y/y f/c 2.1% from 2.4%). The US rounds up today\u2019s reports with its April House Price Index (m/m f/c 1.4% from 1.5% - Forex Factory). Finally, US April S&P Case Shiller Home Price Index (y/y f/c 14.5% from 13.3%) is released. ECB President Christine Lagarde is due to speak at a Brussels Economic Forum. US FOMC member Thomas Barkin (President \u2013 Richmond Fed) speaks in a webinar hosted by Market News International.\n\nTrading Perspective: As we approach the month and quarter end, and into Friday\u2019s US Payrolls report, we can expect liquidity to dry up with conditions thin. Currency moves will be dictated by supply/demand factors heading in the June quarter finish. That said, tonight\u2019s German and Eurozone Inflation data are important. Wages will be the focus on the US Jobs report released this Friday. While the US Dollar maintains an edge against its rivals (due to the recent inflation spike), the fall in US bond yields, not matched entirely by drops in other yields bears watching. Speculative market positioning will also play its part. The latest Commitment of Traders/CFTC report (week ended 22 June) which followed the hawkish Fed FOMC meeting outcome saw a large reduction of USD short bets against the Euro, Sterling, and Japanese Yen. Net long Euro bets were reduced to a 7-week low. Aussie short bets though increased to -AUD 17,575 contracts, which is just about 100% of its yearly high.\n\nAUD/USD \u2013 while the Aussie continues its grind lower, net short speculative market positioning will limit further downside. Downside pressure on the AUD/USD pair is still strong. The western city of Perth entered a 4-day lockdown after a third Covid-19 case was recorded. AUD/USD has immediate support at 0.7550 (overnight low 0.75544) followed by 0.7530 and 0.7500. Immediate resistance can be found at 0.7580 and 0.7600.

Not good to exchange rate relationships.\n\nOverall exchange rate relationships are simplified by a $4 calculator and as the most vitally important tool, a trader must possess in the trading arsenal. Understanding is half the battle to winning. A vast majority of traders today employ charts, faulty indicators, wrong positioned moving averages, and apply it to an incorrect currency and/or market price. The currency and market price is never correct so the system is set up for failure."}, {"headline": "The Powell testimony is likely to control sentiment", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "FXStreet", "date": "2 weeks ago", "image": "https://editorial.fxstreet.com/images/Macroeconomics/CentralBanks/FED/Jerome Powell 1Fed__Large.jpg", "author": [], "body": "Outlook: The big data release is existing home sales today and new home sales tomorrow. These are not market-movers in FX, although the press is warning that once again, big investment houses are picking up houses to rent out. This smells bad, mostly because giant corporations make lousy landlords, as we saw in the great housing disruption following 2008-09. This time it\u2019s not the cheap foreclosures they are after, but an expectation of endlessly higher housing prices that will allow endlessly higher rents. It won\u2019t be long before we get some critical academic treatment of the role of rents and rentiers. It\u2019s not pretty. Gittler at BDSwiss has a cute description\u2014\u201cThe US housing market has gone full Bitcoin.\u201d He cites one nugget\u2014housing prices in Phoenix AZ are up over 10% in just the last 30 days.\n\nThe Powell testimony today is likely to control sentiment. Technically he is speaking to the House Select Subcommittee on the Covid Crisis. His opening remarks have already been released and according to those who have seen them, he repeats the comments from the last FOMC. The only issue is whether any House members ask questions he could fumble. But Powell is a competent guy and tends not to fumble nor to obfuscate. Powell will stay true to form and downplay both inflation and the scary idea of accelerated tapering/hikes. The WSJ has his back today, too, with a well-illustrated article on how inflation fades when the base effect is removed by looking at current data vs. pre-pandemic data.\n\nThe quest worldwide to fix fragile and frayed supply chains is a big deal. Various countries, including the US and Japan, plan to invest heavily in chip production, for example. But China still has a largely controlling role. The FT reports a Covid outbreak in a shipping port last month forced a lockdown and that, together with surging new demand, has led to gigantic increases in shipping costs. See the chart. \u201c\u2026 the cost of sending a 40-ft container on Asia to North Europe route recently topped $11,000 for the first time, up from about $8,500 in mid-May and $2,000 last October, according to Freightos.\u201d\n\nShipping costs are, of course, a contributor to overall inflation, but is likely to be one of those inflexible that gets fixed fast. Shipping logistics experts are scrambling to reroute ships and one says we will get back to pre-Covid supply chain reliability in 6 to 9 months.\n\nThe problem facing economists and chartists alik this morning is how to predict the response to a less-hawkish Fed. We still have two important regional Feds, Dallas Kaplan, and St. Louis Bullard, promoting the idea of accelerated tapering/hikes. The rules of Fed management specifically call for each regional and Board Fed to be allowed to speak his own mind, the only exception being the period immediately preceding an Open Market Committee meeting. In other words, Powell does not have the ability to rein in maverick Feds, even if he wanted to.\n\nThe implication for the dollar is that its meteoric rise is ending. But a stop-and-reverse move like we just had in the euro is vanishingly rare. We complain that breaking norms like the Bollinger bands and standard error channel leaves us without guidance, but at the same time, we can\u2019t expect prices to fall back into their old channels as though the breakouts were just dismissible aberrations. They are not dismissible. Most breakouts are, indeed, false, meaning they fade away and the previous move reasserts itself. But not when the breakout is as big as this. It\u2019s a judgment, but we\u2019d say this is not a false breakout\u2014but we won\u2019t know for some time and certainly not today and maybe not this week.\n\nIf the breakout is real, we expect the euro to resume its down move, and then we are looking for a test of the previous low, 1.1722 from March 30\u2014despite being oversold. We had something similar in Jan-Feb. Other currencies are trickier, especially sterling and the AUD/CAD. The BoE is expected to say dovish on the grounds the extension of the lockdown calls for prudence, but you never know. As for the AUD and CAD, they are expected to be leaders in exiting extreme QE. Why would they not benefit from rising rates?\n\nOne nagging worry\u2014the delta variants get a grip in the US and we get another wave of Covid. There is no appetite for a lockdown anywhere, let alone the states where low vaccination rates prevail. This cuts into recovery and raises the risk of prolonging ultra-easy conditions. Do we get risk-off and dollar buying as a result, or risk-off and get out of dollars because the growth/reflation trajectory is damaged? Nobody knows the answer to that one.\n\nThis is an excerpt from \u201cThe Rockefeller Morning Briefing,\u201d which is far larger (about 10 pages).
