Therefore, we expect ETH/USD to move lower towards the $2,000 over the next few days to set a higher low.\n\nCryptocurrency heat map. Source: Coin360\n\nThe overall market trades in the green over the last 24 hours. Bitcoin has gained 2 percent while Ethereum 4.2 percent. The rest of the market follows this pattern of slightly bullish results.\n\nEthereum price movement in the last 24 hours\n\nETH/USD traded in a range of $2,190 \u2013 $2,342, indicating a moderate amount of volatility. Trading volume has remained relatively flat and totals $19 billion. Meanwhile, the total market cap stands at around $269.3 billion, resulting in a market dominance of 18.4 percent.\n\nETH/USD 4-hour chart \u2013 ETH ready to retrace?\n\nOn the 4-hour chart, we can see the Ethereum price spiking above the $2,300 mark over the past hours and currently preparing to retrace some of the gains.\n\nThe overall market still trades with a bearish price action development. Earlier this month we saw ETH/USD move lower from the $2,900 previous significant resistance, resulting in a loss of 40 percent.\n\nSupport was finally established around $1,725 and retested a couple of days later. From there, ETH/USD finally pushed higher earlier this week until the $2,300 resistance, which previously acted as strong support, was reached.\n\nAfter a retracement of Thursday to the $2,000 mark, Ethereum price set a higher low and made another push higher over the last 24 hours. A slightly higher high was set above the $2,300 mark over the past hours, likely indicating that the overall week-long momentum is now exhausted.\n\nTherefore, we can expect ETH/USD to reverse back to the downside later today and start heading towards the $1,900 support next to set a higher low. ETH/USD will likely lose even more if a further downside is seen and set another major lower swing low.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis: Conclusion\n\nEthereum price analysis is bearish for today as the market set a higher high over the last hours and currently prepares to retrace lower. This should lead ETH towards another higher low set, and further upside move attempt next week.\n\nWhile waiting for Ethereum to retrace, read our guides on DeFi advantages, Bitcoin fee, as well as what can you buy with Bitcoin.\n\nDisclaimer.

Numerous third-parties now operate within its ecosystem.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSure, it\u2019s still far away from starting to give Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) a run for its money, or the \u201cEthereum killers,\u201d like Cardano (CCC:ADA-USD), for that matter.\n\nYet, with its smart contract capabilities, solid transaction speeds, and focus on being a bridge between centralized and decentralized systems, it does look set to quickly enter that category.\n\nTo top it all off, as InvestorPlace\u2019s Tezcan Gecgil recently discussed, it\u2019s a carbon-negative platform.\n\nThis by itself may not help it become one of the most widely-used cryptos out there. But, as proof-of-work cryptos like Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) get called out for their environmental impact, it\u2019s another positive for this proof-of-stake blockchain.\n\nIts prospects may look bright, but, keep in mind this may not immediately translate into higher prices for its native token.\n\nUncertainty continues to hang over the crypto market. It may have more room to fall before it finds its floor. Keep this risk in mind, as it trades for around 83 cents, down big from its all-time high of $3.28.\n\nAlgorand and its Initial Success\n\nIn the two years since going live, this token\u2019s blockchain has seen rapid adoption, from a variety of third-parties.\n\nA recent one of note is MAPay. The healthcare payments processor is using the network to facilitate over $800 million in payments for Bermuda\u2019s healthcare system.\n\nWith this initial success, crypto funds have invested $500 million in projects that run on the Algorand blockchain.\n\nStory continues\n\nGiven what it\u2019s accomplished so far, it\u2019s easy to see continuing to gain in usage in the years ahead. Especially as it continues to launch protocol upgrades, such as one launched recently that improves smart contract development and dApp functionality.\n\nIt\u2019s clear it has the technology. All it needs now is critical mass. With the larger \u201cEthereum killers\u201d offering up similar advantages, this may be a challenge.\n\nAssuming it attracts more capital for its development and its upgrades allow it to continue \u201cleveling up,\u201d it looks primed to become a front-runner, like Cardano, or Polygon (CCC:MATIC-USD).\n\nAlgorand\u2019s best days may lie ahead. A few years down the road it could be worth many times what it trades for today.\n\nBut, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s all uphill from here. As crypto market uncertainty still looms, it may first make a trip back toward its pre-bubble prices.\n\nDespite Strengths, ALGO Could See Another Pullback\n\nAs of this writing, cryptos across the board are trading sideways. This may signal to some that we\u2019ve reached the \u201cbottom,\u201d after the sell-off that kicked off in mid-May.\n\nThe waters have been calm. But, we may not have seen the end to the sell-off just yet. The market could still have room to pull back further, before the dust has truly settled.\n\nAlgorand prices could see another double-digit percentage decline. Or worse, a brief trip back under 50 cents per token. That\u2019s where it traded for, prior to the early 2021 bubble. If you do buy it today, be aware of possible near-term volatility.\n\nThere may be a silver lining: a continuation of the crypto bear market could be short-lived. Once speculators who dived into this space late in the game (that is, earlier this year) cash out, but long-minded \u201cHODLers\u201d sit tight, things could bounce back sooner rather than later.\n\nAdmittedly, this may not guarantee a fast trip for cryptos back to their respective high-water marks. It may just mean an end to the declines, with several years of middling performance ahead.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened after the last crash, in 2018. Yet, if you\u2019re looking at this as a long-term crypto investment, and not a short-term trade, this may not be a big concern.\n\nBottom Line: A Possible \u201cEthereum Killer\u201d in the Making\n\nConsidering its capabilities and features, along with its gaining usage, this \u201cnew kid on the crypto block\u201d stands to soon enter \u201cEthereum killer\u201d territory.\n\nThis may make it one one of the better altcoin opportunities you can get in at the ground floor on. Even so, keep in mind the high-risk, and high volatility ahead.\n\nDepending on how long today\u2019s crypto bear market lasts, Algorand may pull back to 50 cents before it bounces back above $1, but if you can handle the volatility and hold it until its blockchain grows in usage, starting to accumulate a position at or below today\u2019s prices appears worthwhile.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel held long positions in Bitcoin and Ethereum.

It is now trading below $34,500 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is also a key bearish trendline forming, with resistance near $33,800 on the BTC/USD pair\u2019s hourly chart. Moving on, the BTC/USD could start a fresh increase over the next days, if it remains stable above the $32,000 support zone. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $33,800 level and the trendline. The next key resistance is near $34,000, above which the price could test the 100-hourly SMA at $34,500. Further gains in the BTC could lift the price towards the $35,000 resistance level. In that case, the buyers could even break a fresh test of $36,500.\n\nBTC/USD\n\nHowever, the ongoing heavy selling bias surrounding the BTC/USD coin could be associated with the stronger US dollar. The broad-based greenback continued to increase against currencies in Asia on the day after the US reported fewer than expected initial jobless claims. The US dollar has been rising gradually since late May, as investors adapt to the possibility that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates sooner than expected. The US currency got some additional support from previously released positive economic data, with US initial jobless claims falling to 364,000, which was well below the market expectations of 390,000, and the lowest number in 15 months.On a different page, the downticks in Bitcoin could be temporary or short-lived, as analyst Scott Melker predicts that Bitcoin could hit the $250,000 level. He showed the monthly chart in his recent analysis video and presented some fascinating predictions. He said that BTC first broke through the EQ line (or mid-line), on the monthly chart, and that from June 2019 to November 2020, the candles for Bitcoin had stayed under the line for nearly 17 months. In December 2020, the currency broke over the line, and it is currently re-testing the support line. Melker predicted where the coin will go from here. As per the keywords, Melker stated: \u201cEven if it went to the top of the channel (the upper trend line) next month, that\u2019d be $158,000, a month later 168, 176. You see it takes a few months\u2026That gets us to those 230, 250, 280 thousand targets.\u201d Ethereum (ETH/USD) Weekly Review Despite the positive comments about the future prices of Ethereum, by the current CEO of Galaxy Digital, Mike Novogratz, the ETH/USD failed to extend its previous winning streak, turning sour well below the $2,050 level. The current Ethereum price is trading near $2,038.68, with a 24-hour trading volume of $25,654,215,885. Ethereum has dropped by 8.46% in the last 24 hours. However, the sharp declines in the Ethereum price could be associated with multiple reasons, be it a stronger US dollar or an unstable market, and all these factors have weakened the ETH price. On the USD front, the broad-based US dollar managed to extend its winning streak of the previous session, and continued to increase against currencies in Asia on the day after the encouraging US initial jobless claims report. The US dollar has been heading slowly upwards since late May, as investors get used to the idea that the US Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates sooner than expected. Thanks to positive economic data and the drop in initial jobless claims, the greenback got some additional support. Thus, the upticks in the US dollar were seen as one of the key factors that kept the ETH/USD coin under pressure.\n\nETH/USD\n\nThe optimism over the bullish prices for Ethereum in the future has also played a major role in helping to limit deeper losses for the cryptocurrency. As per the latest report, the former hedge fund manager and the current CEO of Galaxy Digital, Mike Novogratz, said that Ethereum might overtake Bitcoin soon. Despite this being the first successful attempt at deploying the cryptocurrency, Mike Novogratz remains confident that Ethereum could become the core layer of the semantic web. The former hedge fund manager noted that apart from being the biggest competition to Bitcoin, Ethereum is \u201ca very different use case.\u201d He added: \u201cI think Ethereum will become the second biggest, or maybe even the biggest cryptocurrency one day.\u201d This, in turn, helped to cap the downside correction in the ETH, at least for now.\n\nMeantime, the CEO of Skybridge Capital, Anthony Scaramucci, has declared that Skybridge Capital will launch an Ethereum fund. The plan is that it will be a private fund. Besides this, Skybridge Capital has filed for an Ether ETF with the SEC. The fund already has a pending Bitcoin ETF filed with the SEC. This news failed to exert any meaningful impact on the ETH prices, at least for now. Litecoin (LTC/USD) Weekly Review\n\nThe LTC/USD crypto pair extended its bearish trend of the previous day, dropping by 6.57% in the last 24 hours. Litecoin was trading at the $131.445 level on the day. It is worth recalling that the LTC coin was at $138.900 on Monday \u2013 up by 10.02%. It was the biggest one-day percentage gain since May 31. This upward move pushed Litecoin\u2019s market cap up to $9.156B, or 0.65% of the total cryptocurrency market cap. Litecoin was consolidating within a range between $130.009 and $138.884 in the previous twenty-four hours.\n\nLTC/USD\n\nThe Litecoin market is keeping its place close to $150, after a smaller line of the progressive bullish trend. The market value is now around the 139 mark, at a percentage rate of about -3.34. However, the ongoing gloomy headlines from China over the ban on cryptocurrency mining have been playing a negative role in undermining the LTC prices. It is worth recalling that China recently imposed a ban on cryptocurrency mining. Furthermore, the declines in the LTC prices were further bolstered by the stronger US dollar. The broad-based greenback managed to extend its winning streak of the previous session and increase against Asian currencies on the day, after the US reported fewer initial jobless claims than expected.\n\nRipple (XRP/USD) Weekly Review\n\nThe XRP/USD crypto coin has failed to stop its previous day\u2019s losing streak and remained well offered, around below 0.6400 marks on the day. The XRP is currently trading at the $0.644927 level and dropped by 4.97% in the last 24 hours. The weakness of Ripple (XRP) is considerably apparent now, as the digital asset will have very limited support on the way down to $0.45. Most of the coins are also flashing red numbers; major coins have been holding on quite well. The XRP buyers will now need to see a bounce from any support level to recover their daily uptrends.\n\nMoving on, there could be a bearish reaction if the price of the XRP fails to climb above the 21-day moving average. At the moment, the initial support is below the 9-day moving average. Thus, if a downside breaks below this barrier, the XRP price may test the $0.60 level. However, any more declines are likely to start another bearish wave, and the price could even drop below the $0.35, $0.25, and $0.15 support levels. XRP/USD Ripple (XRP) has recently declared that they have made a strategic investment in Mintable. For those who are interested, Mintable is an NFT marketplace where people can use fiat currency or cryptocurrency to buy, sell or create digital assets. Ripple thinks that, with the arrival of tokenization into the mainstream, the ability to digitally sign assets, sell them and receive income from all subsequent sales markets is a tipping point when it comes to crypto adoption. The belief is that this will push adoption hugely. Ripple is pretty excited to be working with Mintable, which has already announced $13 million in Series A funding. Mintable will utilize the funding to expand support for even more blockchains. However, this positive development might help to limit the downside correction in the Ripple prices. Dogecoin (DOGE/USD) Weekly Review\n\nThe DOGE/USD price managed to extend its bullish overnight streak, drawing some further bids on the day. The Dogecoin price is currently trading at $0.239801 with a 24-hour trading volume of $2,463,047,746. However, the buying bias surrounding the Dogecoin could be attributed to the fresh reports suggesting that Elon Musk has once again tried to boost the price of his favorite crypto, Dogecoin (DOGE), by tweeting about the meme coin to his more than 57 million Twitter followers. Thus, the Dogefather\u2019s social media stunt has boosted the price of DOGE, though its latest hike is still miles away from its $0.73 all-time-high. The global cryptocurrency market is still trying to recover from the massive crash that saw the price of Bitcoin (BTC) and other altcoins, including Elon Musk\u2019s Dogecoin (DOGE), crash by more than 50 percent since May.\n\nDOGE/USD\n\nWhile Musk\u2019s Twitter activities have drawn the ire of financial regulators in the past and have arguably made him the most controversial, albeit hated personality for bitcoin lovers, it appears the multi-billionaire will not turn over a new leaf anytime soon. Good luck and have a lovely day ahead!"}]}, {"id": "EUR/AUD", "price_data": [1.5424799919128418, 1.543529987335205, 1.5431699752807617, 1.5430799722671509, 1.5438899993896484, 1.543030023574829,

Forex", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://www.actionforex.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/f-eur9-e1600272705134.jpg", "author": [], "body": "Dollar ended as the strongest one last week but Friday\u2019s steel fall after solid non-farm payroll job reports suggests that it\u2019s rally is already losing steam. It\u2019s still a bit early to call a bearish reversal for the greenback. Yet, strong risk-on sentiments could cap Dollar\u2019s upside attempts ahead, and even trigger a deeper pull back.\n\nEuro ended as the second weakest, next to Aussie, but the late development in EUR/AUD suggests that the favor is not on Euro\u2019s side. More importantly, developments in some crosses like EUR/CHF and EUR/CAD indicates that market focuses might turn to selling in Euro in crosses ahead. On the other hand, the late rebound in Canadian Dollar opens up some upside prospects for the near term.\n\nNASDAQ closed at new record, heading to 15k handle\n\nNASDAQ\u2019s up trend continued last wee after some hesitation, and finished with a strong close at new record high of 14639.32. Near term outlook will remain bullish as long as 14439.90 supports. Next target is 61.8% projection of 10822.57 to 14175.11 from 13002.53 at 15074.39.\n\nThat would be an important level to overcome as it\u2019s firstly close to 15k handle. More importantly, a strong break of 15k could put weekly MACD back into a rising track. That would in turn argues that NASDAQ is back in medium term up side acceleration. Strong break of 15k would set the stage for even more powerful rise in this 2H of the year.\n\nDOW to catch to resume record run.\n\nDOW also made some notable progress even though it\u2019s still lagging behind S&P 500 and NASDAQ. Current development argues that consolidation pattern from 35091.56 has already completed at 33271.93, after brief breach of medium term channel support.\n\nDOW could take on 35091.56 record high this week, and break will confirm resumption of larger up trend from 18213.65. Next target would be 100% projection of 18213.65 to 2919935 from 26143.77 at 37129.47.\n\nDollar index failed to extend rally, but more upside still mildly in favor\n\nDollar\u2019s development was rather disappointing, as it reacted more to strong risk-on sentiments much more than the solid NFP report. It\u2019s still too early to call an end to the rise from 89.53 as long as 91.51 support holds. Further rally would still be seen to 93.43 resistance and possibly above.\n\nBut we\u2019d maintain that rise from 89.53 is seen as the third leg of the consolidation pattern from 89.20. Hence, we\u2019d expect strong resistance from 38.2% retracement of 102.99 to 89.20 at 94.46 at 94.46. to limit upside, at least to extend sideway trading. Break of 91.51 will suggest that such rise has completed prematurely, and bring retest of 89.20/53 support zone.\n\nEUR/CHF and EUR/CAD turn weaker, more downside ahead\n\nEuro turned notably weaker in some crosses last week. In particular, EUR/CHF\u2019s break of 1.0939 support argues that rebound from 1.0863 has completed at 1.0985 already. It\u2019s also kept below medium term channel resistance, and struggled to sustain above 55 day EMA. The development argues that choppy decline from 1.1149 is still in progress.\n\nDeeper fall is not in favor for the near term to retest 1.0863 support first. Break will resume the fall from 1.1149 to cluster support level at 1.0737, 61.8% retracement of 1.0505 to 1.1149 at 1.0751.\n\nEUR/CAD also dropped notably on Friday and deeper fall is now in favor this week to retest 1.4580 support. The failure to sustain above falling 55 day EMA keeps near term outlook bearish. Break of 1.14580 will confirm resumption of larger decline from 1.5978 and target 61.8% projection of 1.5783 to 1.4723 from 1.5191 at 1.4536. Firm break there could bring further downside acceleration to 1.4263 long term support next.\n\nCanadian Dollar has some upside prospect ahead\n\nOn the other hand, Canadian Dollar has the prospect of turning stronger, with help from persistently strong oil price, BoC tapering expectation. But that would be subject to the upcoming employment data this week. Anyway, AUD/CAD\u2019s breach of 0.9258 support argues that larger fall from 0.9991 is resuming. Focus is back on 0.9247 key cluster support level (38.2% retracement of 0.8058 to 0.9991 at 0.9253).\n\nSustained break of 0.9247/53 will bring some downside re-acceleration to 61.8% projection of 0.9757 to 0.9258 from 0.9394 at 0.9086. There is prospect of even deeper fall to 61.8% retracement of 0.8058 to 0.9991 at 0.8796. Strong rebound from current level, followed by break of 0.9394 resistance will suggest short term bottoming, and bring turn the fortune between Aussie and Loonie.\n\nAUD/USD Weekly Outlook\n\nAUD/USD edged lower to 0.7443 last week but quickly recovered again. Initial bias is turned neutral this week first. Another fall could still be seen, and break of 0.7443 will resume the whole corrective pattern from 0.8006. But we\u2019d expect strong support from 100% projection of 0.8006 to 0.7530 from 0.7890 at 0.7414 to bring rebound. On the upside, break of 0.7615 resistance will indicate short term bottoming, on bearish divergence condition in 4 hour MACD. Intraday bias will be turned back to the upside for 0.7890/8006 resistance zone.\n\nIn the bigger picture, rise from 0.5506 medium term bottom could either be the start of a long term up trend, or a corrective rise. Reactions to 0.8135 key resistance will reveal which case it is. Rejection by 0.8135 key resistance, followed by firm break of 0.7413 resistance turned support, will favors the latter case.

This highly regulated firm offers a complete foreign exchange solution complete with 24/7 phone support.\n\nOFX Money Transfers \u2013 Reviewed and Compared\n\nOFX: A Summary OFX has a 20-year history and is one of the largest foreign exchange specialists in the world. It offers a complete foreign exchange solution, including discounted money transfers, currency hedging tools, recurring transfers, a multi-currency account for online sellers and much more. OFX is highly regulated and its 1 million customers now benefit from true 24/7 phone support. Though OFX clearly offers bank-beating FX costs, it is slightly more expensive than some other services in the market, particularly for more exotic currencies. Positive Bank-beating exchange rates\n\nLow minimum transfer size (AUD 250, GBP 100)\n\nPlace transfer orders online or by phone\n\nExcellent 24/7 customer service\n\nLongstanding company with vast FX experience\n\nFX forwards, bulk and recurring payments\n\n80 percent of money transfers completed within 1 business day Negative Transfers to bank accounts only\n\nLimit orders for large transfers only (A$30,000, \u00a320,000 etc.)\n\nWhat Savings Can I Expect?\n\nOFX offers exchange rates that put the banks to shame, though they aren\u2019t quite as good value as those offered by the industry\u2019s lowest-cost services.\n\nWith OFX, the cost of sending, for example, 5,000 Australian dollars to the US equates to 0.85 percent of the transferred amount, or roughly AUD42.5. You\u2019d pay roughly 1 percent for the same amount to be sent to Europe but 2 percent if sending to India. This compares with 4\u20137 percent with the banks.\n\nFor other currency routes we looked at (routes involving AUD, INR, GBP, EUR, SGD and USD), the average cost of an international payment with OFX was 0.6 percent of the transferred amount. This is exceptional if compared with banks but is perhaps double what is charged by the industry\u2019s lowest-cost services, although such services might not offer the same benefits as OFX.\n\nIMPORTANT: For BestExchangeRates readers, OFX will waive its flat A$15 transfer fee permanently, so be sure to sign up via one of our links.\n\nBe aware that transferred funds might be subject to a third-party bank receiving fee. Such fees are entirely out of OFX\u2019s control and OFX receives no part of them. You can phone OFX\u2019s support line to seek further information on third-party fees.\n\nOFX Foreign Transfer Rates & Fees - Compared\n\nLoading rates... Provider Amounts Rate Cost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Long Will My Transfer Take?\n\nAfter OFX receives your funds, these will usually arrive at the destination bank account within 2 business days. 80 percent of OFX transfers are received within 1 business day.\n\nMinimum / Maximum Transfer Size\n\nOFX has low minimums. You can transfer any amount above AUD 250 or GBP 100 or local currency equivalent.\n\nThe maximum amount you can transfer depends on the currency being sent. Major currencies like USD, GBP, AUD, CAD, EUR and NZD can usually be transferred freely, and OFX can handle billions worth of these. However, controlled currencies like the Chinese yuan, South African rand and South Korean won might be subject to government restrictions.\n\nIs Money Safe with OFX?\n\nThe short answer is \u201cyes\u201d \u2014 as safe as it can be.\n\nOFX deploys top-notch security systems, is highly regulated and has an inherently low-risk business model, which means that it offers a deliverable-only FX service and does not take positions in the markets, thereby eliminating market risk.\n\nAs for your money, this is held separately from OFX\u2019s own funds in a major financial institution.\n\nAs part of its account-protecting technology, OFX deploys algorithms that monitor registrations, logins and transactions to identify suspicious activity, and other tech includes a multi-layered fraud prevention system that works against phishing, malware and apps that might target customer accounts.\n\nNeedless to say, SSL encryption is used to keep your information safe from prying digital eyes.\n\nOFX is regulated by more than 55 different financial authorities, including the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).\n\nAll said, we cannot see any reason why funds would be at risk with OFX.\n\nSupport for Online Retailers: Multi-Currency Accounts\n\nOFX has recently added support for online sellers on Amazon, eBay, Newegg, Buy.com, Shop.com and many other marketplaces. This support comes in the form of the OFX Global Currency Account, which provides local currency accounts for each of the following: USD, GBP, HKD, EUR, CAD and AUD.\n\nFunds from your marketplace or payment gateway can be paid straight into a Global Currency Account and suppliers can also be paid at the best possible exchange rates. With such an account, your online business can avoid a great deal of the unnecessary back-and-forth FX charges associated with cross-border trade. Visit OFX for Online Sellers.\n\nAdvanced Features: Forwards, Limit Orders, Bulk and Recurring Payments\n\nOFX provides a number of risk and FX management features that businesses will appreciate.\n\nForward contracts are an effective way of managing foreign currency exposures for those who stand to lose significant amounts if exchange rates move against them in the coming days or months (up to 12 months). A forward buyer can lock in an exchange rate today for a transfer that will be paid for in future. Once you\u2019ve signed up with OFX, give one of their reps a call to discuss your unique hedging requirements.\n\nBulk payments, such as those needed for payrolls, are easily done using Multipay, which allows for 500 payments to be sent at once.\n\nLimit orders allow users to convert money at exchange rates better than today\u2019s. Once a desired rate has been specified, OFX systems will monitor the FX market on a user\u2019s behalf, triggering money transfers once the market rate matches the desired rate. A downside of this feature is that it comes with a minimum transaction size of AUD 30,000 or GBP 20,000 (varies by currency).\n\nRecurring transfers are available, such as those needed for overseas mortgages. With OFX, a payment plan can be set up at a fixed, agreed-upon exchange rate so you know exactly what you\u2019re spending each month.\n\nCustomer Service\n\nCustomer service at OFX is 24/7 and support options are excellent. These include 10 national phone lines reaching support staff in 7 countries, email support and an extensive FAQ section on the main site.\n\nThough there are disappointed customers to be found online, as there are with any service, the bulk of OFX customers (we estimate 80 percent) report highly professional support when things go wrong, with adjectives like \u201cthorough,\u201d \u201cunderstanding,\u201d \u201cprompt\u201d and \u201cknowledgeable\u201d used to describe OFX staff.\n\nOFX outlines a complaints policy on its site but be aware that a final response to complaints might take as long as 45 days, which is longer than we\u2019d like.\n\nWhat Do Users Think of OFX?\n\nAt the time of writing this review (June 2019), more than 3,000 of the 3,500 Trustpilot reviewers had rewarded OFX a 5-star rating, and that should speak volumes. As you\u2019d expect from any top firm in the payments industry, common themes within reviews relate to: \u201cgreat exchange rates,\u201d \u201cexcellent service,\u201d \u201cbetter than the banks,\u201d \u201cquick service\u201d and \u201ceasy to get hold of,\u201d among others.\n\n\n\nCustomers registering through BER will have all their fees waived.\n\nMore OFX Articles\n\nOFX Global Currency Account \u2013 BER Review OFX Global Currency Account \u2013 Independent BER Review OFX Global Currency Account: A Summary OFX has a 30-year history and is one of the largest foreign exchange specialists in the world.

Planning oi-Vipul Das\n\nThe Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 defines the statutory context for the management of foreign exchange transactions in India. Under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), 1999, all transactions encompassing foreign exchange are categorised as either capital or current account transactions. All residents, including minors, are entitled to remit up to USD 2,50,000 each financial year for any authorised current or capital account transaction, or both, under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS). For all LRS transactions performed through authorised persons, the resident individual must give his or her Permanent Account Number (PAN).\n\nThe number of remittances is unrestricted under the LRS. However, throughout a financial year, the overall amount of foreign exchange acquired from or sent through all channels in India should not exceed USD 2,50,000. A resident citizen would not be entitled to make any additional remittances under this scheme after making one for an amount up to USD 2,50,000 during the financial year. However, depending on the form of remittance, you may encounter some limitations on the amount you need to send.\n\nFor example, if you are a customer of State Bank of India, you are entitled to the current limit of USD 2, 50,000 each financial year under the RBI's Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS). Within the total threshold of LRS, per transaction cap is equivalent to Rs.20 lacs or USD 25,000, whichever is lower on the day of transaction if made through a bank branch. Within the total limit of LRS, each transaction cap through Retail Internet Banking (INB) is equivalent to Rs.10 lacs or USD 25,000, whichever is lower on the day of transaction. This service is accessible in USD, GBP, EUR, AUD, SGD, CAD, and 91 other currencies at all SBI branches.\n\nIs foreign remittance is taxable in India?\n\nMoney remitted outside India will be subject to a 5% tax collected at the source (TCS). The TCS rate will be 0.5 per cent of the money sent if the transfer is paid out against a loan acquired for higher education. In this context, the Finance Act of 2020 added a new sub-section (1G) to Section 206C. TCS will apply to remittances that are transferred outside of India under the Reserve Bank of India's Liberalized Remittance Scheme (LRS). LRS permits residents to transfer up to $250,000 each fiscal year to cover expenditures such as travel, medical care, education, gifts and donations, upkeep of the close family, and so on. Indian citizens can also establish, and manage foreign currency accounts with banks outside of India for the purpose of carrying out the scheme's authorized transactions. Needless to say, unless tax has already been deducted at source (TDS), every overseas transfer above Rs 7 lakh would be subject to a tax-collected-at-source (TCS). Please remember that the TCS will only apply to the amount over Rs 7 lakh in a given financial year.\n\nFor investment related articles, business news and mutual fund advise Allow Notifications\n\nStory first published: Friday, July 2, 2021, 9:47 [IST]"}, {"headline": "Top 10 Online Forex Brokers in 2021", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Economy Watch", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://www.economywatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/eToro-3-1024x598.png", "author": [], "body": "If you are interested in forex trading and want to make a career out of it, the first thing you need to do is look for a reputable and reliable broker.

So, it is crucial to carefully choose one among the many available in the forex market.\n\nTake a look at the best forex brokers of 2021 below.\n\nLeading UK Forex Brokers\n\nWhat is a Forex Broker?\n\nIn the foreign exchange market or vastly known as the forex market, the transactions primarily conduct between a pair of two independent currencies. In the course of buying and selling cryptocurrencies, a forex broker is typically a financial service company that acts as an intermediary between the trader and the interbank system. While making a transaction between a pair of currencies that are generally made of the ten most traded and liquid currencies including USD, EUR, AUD, and others, traders can initiate and execute a trade using a forex broker and earn profit depending on the current exchange rate.\n\nHow Do Forex Brokers Work?\n\nThe forex broker typically works as an intermediary between you and the interbank system, which is a network of banks that trade with each other daily. The broker will typically offer you a price from the banks and financial institutions through which they have access to forex liquidity.\n\nWhen you start trading with a forex broker and open your first trade, the broker will pass it through the market. They offer you a price for that particular forex pair, typically shown in quote form such as GBP/USD 1.3500/1.3505. Here, the first number is the rate the broker offers you if you want to sell the pair. The second number shows the rate at which you can buy the pair. The difference between the numbers i.e., .0005 or 5 pips is taken as a commission by the broker and is known as the spread.\n\nA broker will typically provide you with a trading platform, which is a software program that can either be downloaded or used via a browser on the web. This is the main platform where you buy and sell currencies, monitor trades, conduct technical analysis, and all related functions of trading. Once the broker executes your order, it can either be a winning or a losing trade, leading to a profit or loss for your trading account.\n\nBest UK Forex Brokers \u2013 Top 10 Reviewed\n\n1. eToro \u2013 Best of the Best Forex Brokers\n\nFounded in 2007, eToro is one of the leading forex brokers worldwide.

In the course of buying and selling cryptocurrencies, a forex broker is typically a financial service company that acts as an intermediary between the trader and the interbank system. While making a transaction between a pair of currencies that are generally made of the ten most traded and liquid currencies including USD, EUR, AUD, and others, traders can initiate and execute a trade using a forex broker and earn profit depending on the current exchange rate.\n\nHow Do Forex Brokers Work?\n\nThe forex broker typically works as an intermediary between you and the interbank system, which is a network of banks that trade with each other daily. The broker will typically offer you a price from the banks and financial institutions through which they have access to forex liquidity.\n\nWhen you start trading with a forex broker and open your first trade, the broker will pass it through the market. They offer you a price for that particular forex pair, typically shown in quote form such as GBP/USD 1.3500/1.3505. Here, the first number is the rate the broker offers you if you want to sell the pair. The second number shows the rate at which you can buy the pair. The difference between the numbers i.e., .0005 or 5 pips is taken as a commission by the broker and is known as the spread.\n\nA broker will typically provide you with a trading platform, which is a software program that can either be downloaded or used via a browser on the web. This is the main platform where you buy and sell currencies, monitor trades, conduct technical analysis, and all related functions of trading. Once the broker executes your order, it can either be a winning or a losing trade, leading to a profit or loss for your trading account.\n\nKnowing Which UK Forex Brokers Are The Best\n\n\n\nWith a myriad of choices available when it comes to forex brokers, you can easily get confused and end up making a bad choice. This is why you should always ensure that the forex broker you choose meets certain standards of functionality and convenience.\n\nSome of the best forex brokers have the following features.\n\nThe broker should provide convenient deposits and withdrawals without charging outlandish fees.\n\nThe broker should provide convenient deposits and withdrawals without charging outlandish fees.

The broker should be regulated by a major international regulatory body.\n\nDo\u2019s and Don\u2019t\u2019s\n\nPicking the right forex broker will certainly nudge you in the right direction. However, success in the forex market also depends on your actions. You should thus know what to do and what not to do to minimise losses and maximise profits.\n\nDo:\n\nDevelop a concrete plan: You should always try to develop a concrete plan before you dive into the market. Evaluate your goals and objectives before you cast your first trade. Entering the market without a plan can have disastrous consequences, especially if one trades impulsively.\n\nAlways use stop loss and take profit: It\u2019s always important to sit down and evaluate the amount of profit that you feel is realistically achievable. This extends to the use of stop-loss and take-profit levels. Failure to choose fixed levels for closing your trading position will result in closing trades based on emotion.\n\nResearching the market: Staying on top of the factors that affect the forex market. This can extend to international politics, news regarding financial regulations, and other factors such as wars and natural disasters. Typically you would want to get real-time information on factors that affect the currency pair you\u2019re trading, such as the country\u2019s inflation rates and other economic markers.\n\nDon\u2019t:\n\nDon\u2019t commit money you can\u2019t afford to lose: There is a fine line between trading cautiously and outright gambling. So you should always stay within the budget parameters set. It is very easy to get carried away and end up investing more money than you originally planned in forex trading.\n\nDon\u2019t commit revenge trading: Revenge trading is when you try to make up for losses incurred earlier in the day by impulsively executing trades. Do not fall for this trap as you will end up trading using raw emotion rather than trading rules, leading to more losses. You should rather use take-profit levels to lock your gains once you reach your profit target levels. This will alleviate the temptation for further gains.\n\nDon\u2019t let emotions take over: Human emotions such as greed and fear can lead to impractical trading decisions where you will end up incurring a loss. For instance, fear can lead to traders closing their positions early missing out on profits. Always remember that you should stick to your set plan and exit the market once your target profit level for the day has been achieved.\n\nHow to Begin Trading With Forex Brokers \u2013 eToro Guide\n\n\n\nOnce you have made up your mind about which forex broker to use for trading your preferred forex pairs then all that is left to do is start trading.

Furthermore, consumer\u2019s outlook on whether jobs are \u2018plentiful\u2019 over \u2018hard to get\u2019 rose to its highest differential since 2000, which could bode well for Friday\u2019s NFP report if that indeed turns out to be the current situation.\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 extended their record highs, with the S&P 500 extending its record for a fourth consecutive session. Yet volatility was low overall with the S&P and Dow Jones rising just 0.3% and the Nasdaq rose 0.33%.\n\nIn Europe equities had a positive start yet failed to hold onto early gains to close effectively flat. The FTSE 100 and CAC printed bearish hammers inside Monday\u2019s bearish ranges, so we are still on guard for a bearish break on the FTSE of Monday\u2019s low.\n\nThe ASX 200 threw a spanner in the works of the symmetrical triangle discussed yesterday, by teasing bears with a downside break yet recovering later in the session to close flat with a bullish pinbar. Considering this is as 10 million Australian\u2019s went into lockdown then it\u2019s not a bad close at all. As it stands, we would still consider longs with a break above Friday\u2019s high to suggest momentum had realigned with its bullish trend.\n\n\n\n\n\nASX 200 Market Internals:\n\n\n\n\n\nASX 200: 7301.2 (-0.08%), 28 June 2021\n\nInformation Technology (0.65%) was the strongest sector and Materials (-0.68%) was the weakest\n\n8 out of the 11 sectors closed higher\n\n78 (39.20%) stocks advanced, 111 (55.78%) stocks declined\n\n8 hit a new 52-week high, 2 hit a new 52-week low\n\n71.36% of stocks closed above their 200-day average\n\n64.32% of stocks closed above their 50-day average\n\n47.24% of stocks closed above their 20-day average\n\nOutperformers:\n\n+ 5.69% - Metcash Ltd (MTS.AX)\n\n+ 4.96% - Nuix Ltd (NXL.AX)\n\n+ 3.47% - Lynas Rare Earths Ltd (LYC.AX)\n\nUnderperformers:\n\n-5.67% - Collins Foods Ltd (CKF.AX)\n\n-5.18% - Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield SE (URW.AX)\n\n-4.6% - Nufarm Ltd (NUF.AX)\n\n\n\n\n\nForex: Delta outbreaks weighs on commodity FX\n\nThe latest coronavirus outbreak saw the USD and JPY rise on safe-haven flows and weigh on commodity currencies (AUD, CAD and NZD). Commodity currencies were the weakest majors overnight and the weakest month-to-date.\n\nThe Japanese yen was the strongest major as the risk-off sentiment apparent in yesterday\u2019s Asian session spilled over to the European and US ones. The yen was up against all its major peers but made the most ground against the Australian dollar as several states have headed back into lockdown and the Delta variant rose across parts of Asia. AUD/JPY was the biggest mover, shedding -0.8% in line with our bearish bias and its ranges topping near its 10-day ATR and hitting the initial target of 0.8300. Its next support level is 82.76. Strong economic sentiment for Europe lifted EUR/AUD to our near-term bullish target at its 200-day eMA.\n\nThe US dollar index (DXY) moved higher in line with its double bottom breakout, rose to a six-day high and made it around \u00be of its way to the double bottom target at 92.30. USD/CHF stopped just shy of our June high target and GBP/USD came just 14 pips from our initial 1.3800 target. AUD/USD and NZD/USD both closed firmly beneath their 200-day eMA\u2019s after printing prominent highs.\n\n\n\n\n\nUSD/JPY was just -0.1% lower by the close but intraday price action suggests the move to be corrective. Its trend remains bullish overall, and prices are accelerating away from trendline support to show a pickup of momentum. Prices have also retraced for four consecutive days since last week\u2019s high. Moreover, prices have formed a Doji and respected a cluster of support including the monthly R1 and pivot and weekly pivot point and 20-day eMA. Therefore, if prices can break above yesterday\u2019s high without breaking the support zone then bulls could assume momentum is trying to realign with its bullish trend.\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn how to trade forex\n\n\n\n\n\nCommodities: Metals feel the weight of a stronger dollar\n\nGold and silver finally woke up from their small but choppy sideways ranges with downside breaks.

AUD/USD is around -0.2% lower.\n\nEUR/AUD printed a bullish outside candle yesterday, suggesting a swing low has formed. That it occurred back above the 1.5690 high and is also a \u2018higher low\u2019 adds extra weight to this argument. However, given the 200-day eMA sits just beneath this month\u2019s high means we are only bullish o this pair over the near-term.\n\nThe Japanese yen was the strongest currency overnight, rising against all of its major peers. AUD/JPY fell to a five-day low and is currently around -0.28% lower, EUR/JPY is down -0.2% and NZD/JPY is down by -0.3%.\n\nThe US dollar was slightly former overnight against all but the yen. GBP/USD touched a six-day low after breaking beneath yesterday\u2019s bearish pinbar although volatility is lacking somewhat. EUR/USD looks like it wants to turn lower on the daily chart, given the series of upper wicks last week (selling tails) which all closed beneath the 200-day eMA. Yet, whist there\u2019s a hesitancy to push higher there is also clearly a hesitancy to push lower as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf sentiment is to remain sour then AUD/JPY is once again of interest for bears, as momentum is pointing lower once more. The cross fell nearly -3% in three days when trend support broke on the 21st June, although it clawed back most losses with a counter-trend move. Yet notice the small candles near the 20 and 50-day eMA which occurred before Monday\u2019s sell-off. And price action overnight is pushing lower to suggest a swing high is in place at Friday\u2019s high (84.44). At the time of writing, prices are trying to break beneath the weekly pivot point which would bring the 83.00 level and weekly S1 into focus for bars.\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn how to trade forex\n\n\n\n\n\nCommodities:\n\nWith the exception of platinum and palladium, metals are stuck in sideways ranges. Gold and silver lack basic direction and copper has probed yesterday\u2019s 3-day low. Platinum appears to have printed a swig high below its 200-day eMA (see today\u2019s video) yet palladium looks quite firm at its 7-day high. Unless a bearish reversal pattern occurs then a break above the 2720 low assumes bullish continuation.\n\nOil prices fell for a second consecutive day as concerns arise that demand will take a knock with the rise in Covid cases across parts of Asia, seeing WTI futures fall -0.52% to a four-day low\n\nUp Next (Times in BST)\n\nYou can view all the scheduled events for today using our economic

day ago", "image": "https://www.actionforex.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/f-eur9-e1600272705134.jpg", "author": [], "body": "Dollar ended as the strongest one last week but Friday\u2019s steel fall after solid non-farm payroll job reports suggests that it\u2019s rally is already losing steam. It\u2019s still a bit early to call a bearish reversal for the greenback. Yet, strong risk-on sentiments could cap Dollar\u2019s upside attempts ahead, and even trigger a deeper pull back.\n\nEuro ended as the second weakest, next to Aussie, but the late development in EUR/AUD suggests that the favor is not on Euro\u2019s side. More importantly, developments in some crosses like EUR/CHF and EUR/CAD indicates that market focuses might turn to selling in Euro in crosses ahead. On the other hand, the late rebound in Canadian Dollar opens up some upside prospects for the near term.\n\nNASDAQ closed at new record, heading to 15k handle\n\nNASDAQ\u2019s up trend continued last wee after some hesitation, and finished with a strong close at new record high of 14639.32. Near term outlook will remain bullish as long as 14439.90 supports. Next target is 61.8% projection of 10822.57 to 14175.11 from 13002.53 at 15074.39.\n\nThat would be an important level to overcome as it\u2019s firstly close to 15k handle. More importantly, a strong break of 15k could put weekly MACD back into a rising track. That would in turn argues that NASDAQ is back in medium term up side acceleration. Strong break of 15k would set the stage for even more powerful rise in this 2H of the year.\n\nDOW to catch to resume record run.\n\nDOW also made some notable progress even though it\u2019s still lagging behind S&P 500 and NASDAQ. Current development argues that consolidation pattern from 35091.56 has already completed at 33271.93, after brief breach of medium term channel support.\n\nDOW could take on 35091.56 record high this week, and break will confirm resumption of larger up trend from 18213.65. Next target would be 100% projection of 18213.65 to 2919935 from 26143.77 at 37129.47.\n\nDollar index failed to extend rally, but more upside still mildly in favor\n\nDollar\u2019s development was rather disappointing, as it reacted more to strong risk-on sentiments much more than the solid NFP report. It\u2019s still too early to call an end to the rise from 89.53 as long as 91.51 support holds. Further rally would still be seen to 93.43 resistance and possibly above.\n\nBut we\u2019d maintain that rise from 89.53 is seen as the third leg of the consolidation pattern from 89.20. Hence, we\u2019d expect strong resistance from 38.2% retracement of 102.99 to 89.20 at 94.46 at 94.46. to limit upside, at least to extend sideway trading. Break of 91.51 will suggest that such rise has completed prematurely, and bring retest of 89.20/53 support zone.\n\nEUR/CHF and EUR/CAD turn weaker, more downside ahead\n\nEuro turned notably weaker in some crosses last week. In particular, EUR/CHF\u2019s break of 1.0939 support argues that rebound from 1.0863 has completed at 1.0985 already. It\u2019s also kept below medium term channel resistance, and struggled to sustain above 55 day EMA. The development argues that choppy decline from 1.1149 is still in progress.\n\nDeeper fall is not in favor for the near term to retest 1.0863 support first. Break will resume the fall from 1.1149 to cluster support level at 1.0737, 61.8% retracement of 1.0505 to 1.1149 at 1.0751.\n\nEUR/CAD also dropped notably on Friday and deeper fall is now in favor this week to retest 1.4580 support. The failure to sustain above falling 55 day EMA keeps near term outlook bearish. Break of 1.14580 will confirm resumption of larger decline from 1.5978 and target 61.8% projection of 1.5783 to 1.4723 from 1.5191 at 1.4536. Firm break there could bring further downside acceleration to 1.4263 long term support next.\n\nCanadian Dollar has some upside prospect ahead\n\nOn the other hand, Canadian Dollar has the prospect of turning stronger, with help from persistently strong oil price, BoC tapering expectation. But that would be subject to the upcoming employment data this week. Anyway, AUD/CAD\u2019s breach of 0.9258 support argues that larger fall from 0.9991 is resuming. Focus is back on 0.9247 key cluster support level (38.2% retracement of 0.8058 to 0.9991 at 0.9253).\n\nSustained break of 0.9247/53 will bring some downside re-acceleration to 61.8% projection of 0.9757 to 0.9258 from 0.9394 at 0.9086. There is prospect of even deeper fall to 61.8% retracement of 0.8058 to 0.9991 at 0.8796. Strong rebound from current level, followed by break of 0.9394 resistance will suggest short term bottoming, and bring turn the fortune between Aussie and Loonie.\n\nAUD/USD Weekly Outlook\n\nAUD/USD edged lower to 0.7443 last week but quickly recovered again. Initial bias is turned neutral this week first. Another fall could still be seen, and break of 0.7443 will resume the whole corrective pattern from 0.8006. But we\u2019d expect strong support from 100% projection of 0.8006 to 0.7530 from 0.7890 at 0.7414 to bring rebound. On the upside, break of 0.7615 resistance will indicate short term bottoming, on bearish divergence condition in 4 hour MACD. Intraday bias will be turned back to the upside for 0.7890/8006 resistance zone.\n\nIn the bigger picture, rise from 0.5506 medium term bottom could either be the start of a long term up trend, or a corrective rise. Reactions to 0.8135 key resistance will reveal which case it is. Rejection by 0.8135 key resistance, followed by firm break of 0.7413 resistance turned support, will favors the latter case. Deeper decline would be seen to 38.2% retracement of 0.5506 to 0.8006 at 0.7051 first.\n\nIn the longer term picture, 0.5506 is a long term bottom, on bullish convergence condition in monthly MACD. Focus is now back on 0.8135 structural resistance. Decisive break there will raise the chance that rise from 0.5506 is an impulsive up trend. Next target should be 61.8% retracement at 0.8950 of 1.1079 to 0.5506 and above. Though, rejection by 0.8135 will keep the case of medium to long term sideway consolidation open."}, {"headline": "Foreign transfers with OFX compared", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Best Exchange Rates", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/bestexchangerates.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ofx-header-e1594602502687.jpg?fit=967%2C396&ssl=1", "author": ["Carlos Canada", "Stephen Frost", "Expat Bob", "Rene Fr"], "body": "OFX is one of the world\u2019s largest and best providers of international money transfers. This highly regulated firm offers a complete foreign exchange solution complete with 24/7 phone support.\n\nOFX Money Transfers \u2013 Reviewed and Compared\n\nOFX: A Summary OFX has a 20-year history and is one of the largest foreign exchange specialists in the world. It offers a complete foreign exchange solution, including discounted money transfers, currency hedging tools, recurring transfers, a multi-currency account for online sellers and much more. OFX is highly regulated and its 1 million customers now benefit from true 24/7 phone support. Though OFX clearly offers bank-beating FX costs, it is slightly more expensive than some other services in the market, particularly for more exotic currencies. Positive Bank-beating exchange rates\n\nLow minimum transfer size (AUD 250, GBP 100)\n\nPlace transfer orders online or by phone\n\nExcellent 24/7 customer service\n\nLongstanding company with vast FX experience\n\nFX forwards, bulk and recurring payments\n\n80 percent of money transfers completed within 1 business day Negative Transfers to bank accounts only\n\nLimit orders for large transfers only (A$30,000, \u00a320,000 etc.)\n\nWhat Savings Can I Expect?\n\nOFX offers exchange rates that put the banks to shame, though they aren\u2019t quite as good value as those offered by the industry\u2019s lowest-cost services.\n\nWith OFX, the cost of sending, for example, 5,000 Australian dollars to the US equates to 0.85 percent of the transferred amount, or roughly AUD42.5. You\u2019d pay roughly 1 percent for the same amount to be sent to Europe but 2 percent if sending to India. This compares with 4\u20137 percent with the banks.\n\nFor other currency routes we looked at (routes involving AUD, INR, GBP, EUR, SGD and USD), the average cost of an international payment with OFX was 0.6 percent of the transferred amount. This is exceptional if compared with banks but is perhaps double what is charged by the industry\u2019s lowest-cost services, although such services might not offer the same benefits as OFX.\n\nIMPORTANT: For BestExchangeRates readers, OFX will waive its flat A$15 transfer fee permanently, so be sure to sign up via one of our links.\n\nBe aware that transferred funds might be subject to a third-party bank receiving fee. Such fees are entirely out of OFX\u2019s control and OFX receives no part of them. You can phone OFX\u2019s support line to seek further information on third-party fees.\n\nOFX Foreign Transfer Rates & Fees - Compared\n\nLoading rates... Provider Amounts Rate Cost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Long Will My Transfer Take?\n\nAfter OFX receives your funds, these will usually arrive at the destination bank account within 2 business days. 80 percent of OFX transfers are received within 1 business day.\n\nMinimum / Maximum Transfer Size\n\nOFX has low minimums. You can transfer any amount above AUD 250 or GBP 100 or local currency equivalent.\n\nThe maximum amount you can transfer depends on the currency being sent. Major currencies like USD, GBP, AUD, CAD, EUR and NZD can usually be transferred freely, and OFX can handle billions worth of these. However, controlled currencies like the Chinese yuan, South African rand and South Korean won might be subject to government restrictions.\n\nIs Money Safe with OFX?\n\nThe short answer is \u201cyes\u201d \u2014 as safe as it can be.\n\nOFX deploys top-notch security systems, is highly regulated and has an inherently low-risk business model, which means that it offers a deliverable-only FX service and does not take positions in the markets, thereby eliminating market risk.\n\nAs for your money, this is held separately from OFX\u2019s own funds in a major financial institution.\n\nAs part of its account-protecting technology, OFX deploys algorithms that monitor registrations, logins and transactions to identify suspicious activity, and other tech includes a multi-layered fraud prevention system that works against phishing, malware and apps that might target customer accounts.\n\nNeedless to say, SSL encryption is used to keep your information safe from prying digital eyes.\n\nOFX is regulated by more than 55 different financial authorities, including the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).\n\nAll said, we cannot see any reason why funds would be at risk with OFX.\n\nSupport for Online Retailers: Multi-Currency Accounts\n\nOFX has recently added support for online sellers on Amazon, eBay, Newegg, Buy.com, Shop.com and many other marketplaces. This support comes in the form of the OFX Global Currency Account, which provides local currency accounts for each of the following: USD, GBP, HKD, EUR, CAD and AUD.\n\nFunds from your marketplace or payment gateway can be paid straight into a Global Currency Account and suppliers can also be paid at the best possible exchange rates. With such an account, your online business can avoid a great deal of the unnecessary back-and-forth FX charges associated with cross-border trade. Visit OFX for Online Sellers.\n\nAdvanced Features: Forwards, Limit Orders, Bulk and Recurring Payments\n\nOFX provides a number of risk and FX management features that businesses will appreciate.\n\nForward contracts are an effective way of managing foreign currency exposures for those who stand to lose significant amounts if exchange rates move against them in the coming days or months (up to 12 months). A forward buyer can lock in an exchange rate today for a transfer that will be paid for in future. Once you\u2019ve signed up with OFX, give one of their reps a call to discuss your unique hedging requirements.\n\nBulk payments, such as those needed for payrolls, are easily done using Multipay, which allows for 500 payments to be sent at once.\n\nLimit orders allow users to convert money at exchange rates better than today\u2019s. Once a desired rate has been specified, OFX systems will monitor the FX market on a user\u2019s behalf, triggering money transfers once the market rate matches the desired rate. A downside of this feature is that it comes with a minimum transaction size of AUD 30,000 or GBP 20,000 (varies by currency).\n\nRecurring transfers are available, such as those needed for overseas mortgages. With OFX, a payment plan can be set up at a fixed, agreed-upon exchange rate so you know exactly what you\u2019re spending each month.\n\nCustomer Service\n\nCustomer service at OFX is 24/7 and support options are excellent. These include 10 national phone lines reaching support staff in 7 countries, email support and an extensive FAQ section on the main site.\n\nThough there are disappointed customers to be found online, as there are with any service, the bulk of OFX customers (we estimate 80 percent) report highly professional support when things go wrong, with adjectives like \u201cthorough,\u201d \u201cunderstanding,\u201d \u201cprompt\u201d and \u201cknowledgeable\u201d used to describe OFX staff.\n\nOFX outlines a complaints policy on its site but be aware that a final response to complaints might take as long as 45 days, which is longer than we\u2019d like.\n\nWhat Do Users Think of OFX?\n\nAt the time of writing this review (June 2019), more than 3,000 of the 3,500 Trustpilot reviewers had rewarded OFX a 5-star rating, and that should speak volumes.

The loonie has reversed some of its gains over the last month as more investors return to the greenback, a conventional safe-haven asset. Can the Canadian buck retest 80 cents?\n\nAccording to the Statistics Canada, the national economy contracted 0.3% in April, slightly better than the -0.8% forecast. This is down from the 1.3% gain in March and it was the first monthly decline since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nTwelve of the 20 industrial sectors slumped, led by a steep contraction of 5.5% in retail trade.\n\nEconomists are convinced that this is a one-off and that the rebound will intensify.\n\n\u201cThe good news for services most impacted is that, with a reopening already underway across many regions of the country, those businesses should be the ones leading the economy higher this summer,\u201d CIBC senior economist Royce Mendes said in a research note.\n\nProducer prices advanced for the 10th consecutive month, climbing to 16.4% year-over-year in May. On a monthly basis, the producer price index (PPI) rose 2.7% last month.\n\nRaw material prices also popped in May, rising at an annualized rate of 40.1%, down from the 56.2% surge in the previous month. On a month-over-month basis, raw material prices soared 3.2%, up from 1% in April.\n\nThe loonie might be benefiting from higher energy commodities. August West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures surged $0.72, or 0.99%, to $73.70 per barrel. August natural gas futures edged up $0.008, or 0.22%, to $3.638 per million British thermal units (btu).\n\nSince Canada maintains a current account deficit, exports are crucial for economic growth. Oil and gas remain the country\u2019s top shipments, so any price change can impact the loonie and the broader economy.\n\nThe Canadian bond market was mostly in the red in the middle of the trading week, with the benchmark 10-year yield down 0.017% to 1.4%. The one-year bill shed 0.005% to 0.23%, while the 30-year bond dropped 0.024% to 1.85%.\n\nThe USD/CAD currency pair fell 0.2% to 1.2377, from an opening of 1.2404, at 14:39 GMT on Wednesday.

GBP/AUD as mentioned last week would lead the way to EUR/AUD and AUD/USD. GBP/AUD vital break at 1.8216 and oversold from the 1.8269 close will lead the way again this week to EUR/AUD and AUD/USD. We're looking for longs and short to AUD/USD.\n\nOverall ranges remain severely compressed into week 5 for a vast majority of the 18 currency pairs traded weekly. For the most part this represents trade opportunities as entries and targets are more responsive to shorter ranges. it means possibly doubling up on lots traded to increase weekly profits with a higher accuracy rate.\n\nRanges for GBP/USD and USD/CAD are compressed from normal levels however overall ranges are good and better than most currency pairs. GBP/CAD begins the week deeply oversold and may mean GBP/USD and USD/CAD trade neutral until GBP/CAD works off oversold and settles into a normal price again.\n\nHigher for GBP/USD must break 1.3922 but also note GBP/CHF trading above 1.2667. If GBP/CHF breaks below 1.2667 then GBP/USD will gain speed to trade much lower.\n\nJPY cross pairs remain fairly neutral for the week and the same story for the past 3 weeks.

USD/CHF is the better trade short. USD/CAD as the opposite pair from USD/JPY and USD/CHF begins the week oversold and we are long as usual every week over the past 4 weeks. DXY from the close at 91.81 trades between 91.57 and 92.89. Below 91.57 then range becomes 91.57 to 90.24.\n\nDXY defined is an invention created in 1998 upon EUR/USD introduction. Prior to 1998, the premiere currency of Europe was the German Deutsche Mark as DEM/USD and it was traded against USD/JPY, USD/CHF and USD/CAD. But each European nation prior to 1998 had their own currency.\n\nUSD/CHF at its 0.9166 close and DXY from 91.79 reveals DXY as the dominant USD currency within the USD space based on Correlations yet both are the exact same currency. USD/CHF then serves its purpose as a proxy or surrogate to DXY.\n\nThe DXY introduction offered an extra support or resistance point alongside USD/CHF when both are employed as forecast currencies to exchange rates and other financial instruments such as Gold, stock indices and commodities.\n\nNot only is NZD/USD oversold but also oversold is EUR/NZD and GBP/NZD. This relationship can't and won't work well together. GBP/NZD will dictate direction upon the resolution to 1.9588 from the 1.9620 close.\n\nAUD/CHF and NZD/CHF never big movers but good trades this week against an overbought USD/CHF while CAD/CHF will follow CAD/JPY short this week.\n\nOversold EUR/CAD from the 1.4667 close to travel higher must break 1.4852 and 1.4968 and lower must break below 1.4545 and 1.4453.

Sustained break of 1.0737 cluster support (61.8% retracement of 1.0505 to 1.1149 at 1.0751) will argue that the down trend from 2004 (2018 high) is ready to resume through 1.0505 low. Sustained trading below 55 week EMA (now at 1.0885) will affirm this bearish case. Nevertheless, strong support from 55 week EMA will revive the case for resuming the rise from 1.0505 at a later stage."}, {"headline": "Focus Might Turns to Euro Selling While Dollar Rally Capped by Strong Risk Appetite", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Action Forex", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://www.actionforex.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/f-eur9-e1600272705134.jpg", "author": [], "body": "Dollar ended as the strongest one last week but Friday\u2019s steel fall after solid non-farm payroll job reports suggests that it\u2019s rally is already losing steam. It\u2019s still a bit early to call a bearish reversal for the greenback. Yet, strong risk-on sentiments could cap Dollar\u2019s upside attempts ahead, and even trigger a deeper pull back.\n\nEuro ended as the second weakest, next to Aussie, but the late development in EUR/AUD suggests that the favor is not on Euro\u2019s side. More importantly, developments in some crosses like EUR/CHF and EUR/CAD indicates that market focuses might turn to selling in Euro in crosses ahead. On the other hand, the late rebound in Canadian Dollar opens up some upside prospects for the near term.\n\nNASDAQ closed at new record, heading to 15k handle\n\nNASDAQ\u2019s up trend continued last wee after some hesitation, and finished with a strong close at new record high of 14639.32. Near term outlook will remain bullish as long as 14439.90 supports. Next target is 61.8% projection of 10822.57 to 14175.11 from 13002.53 at 15074.39.\n\nThat would be an important level to overcome as it\u2019s firstly close to 15k handle. More importantly, a strong break of 15k could put weekly MACD back into a rising track. That would in turn argues that NASDAQ is back in medium term up side acceleration. Strong break of 15k would set the stage for even more powerful rise in this 2H of the year.\n\nDOW to catch to resume record run.\n\nDOW also made some notable progress even though it\u2019s still lagging behind S&P 500 and NASDAQ. Current development argues that consolidation pattern from 35091.56 has already completed at 33271.93, after brief breach of medium term channel support.\n\nDOW could take on 35091.56 record high this week, and break will confirm resumption of larger up trend from 18213.65. Next target would be 100% projection of 18213.65 to 2919935 from 26143.77 at 37129.47.\n\nDollar index failed to extend rally, but more upside still mildly in favor\n\nDollar\u2019s development was rather disappointing, as it reacted more to strong risk-on sentiments much more than the solid NFP report. It\u2019s still too early to call an end to the rise from 89.53 as long as 91.51 support holds. Further rally would still be seen to 93.43 resistance and possibly above.\n\nBut we\u2019d maintain that rise from 89.53 is seen as the third leg of the consolidation pattern from 89.20. Hence, we\u2019d expect strong resistance from 38.2% retracement of 102.99 to 89.20 at 94.46 at 94.46. to limit upside, at least to extend sideway trading. Break of 91.51 will suggest that such rise has completed prematurely, and bring retest of 89.20/53 support zone.\n\nEUR/CHF and EUR/CAD turn weaker, more downside ahead\n\nEuro turned notably weaker in some crosses last week. In particular, EUR/CHF\u2019s break of 1.0939 support argues that rebound from 1.0863 has completed at 1.0985 already. It\u2019s also kept below medium term channel resistance, and struggled to sustain above 55 day EMA. The development argues that choppy decline from 1.1149 is still in progress.\n\nDeeper fall is not in favor for the near term to retest 1.0863 support first. Break will resume the fall from 1.1149 to cluster support level at 1.0737, 61.8% retracement of 1.0505 to 1.1149 at 1.0751.\n\nEUR/CAD also dropped notably on Friday and deeper fall is now in favor this week to retest 1.4580 support. The failure to sustain above falling 55 day EMA keeps near term outlook bearish. Break of 1.14580 will confirm resumption of larger decline from 1.5978 and target 61.8% projection of 1.5783 to 1.4723 from 1.5191 at 1.4536. Firm break there could bring further downside acceleration to 1.4263 long term support next.\n\nCanadian Dollar has some upside prospect ahead\n\nOn the other hand, Canadian Dollar has the prospect of turning stronger, with help from persistently strong oil price, BoC tapering expectation. But that would be subject to the upcoming employment data this week. Anyway, AUD/CAD\u2019s breach of 0.9258 support argues that larger fall from 0.9991 is resuming. Focus is back on 0.9247 key cluster support level (38.2% retracement of 0.8058 to 0.9991 at 0.9253).\n\nSustained break of 0.9247/53 will bring some downside re-acceleration to 61.8% projection of 0.9757 to 0.9258 from 0.9394 at 0.9086. There is prospect of even deeper fall to 61.8% retracement of 0.8058 to 0.9991 at 0.8796. Strong rebound from current level, followed by break of 0.9394 resistance will suggest short term bottoming, and bring turn the fortune between Aussie and Loonie.\n\nAUD/USD Weekly Outlook\n\nAUD/USD edged lower to 0.7443 last week but quickly recovered again. Initial bias is turned neutral this week first. Another fall could still be seen, and break of 0.7443 will resume the whole corrective pattern from 0.8006. But we\u2019d expect strong support from 100% projection of 0.8006 to 0.7530 from 0.7890 at 0.7414 to bring rebound. On the upside, break of 0.7615 resistance will indicate short term bottoming, on bearish divergence condition in 4 hour MACD. Intraday bias will be turned back to the upside for 0.7890/8006 resistance zone.\n\nIn the bigger picture, rise from 0.5506 medium term bottom could either be the start of a long term up trend, or a corrective rise. Reactions to 0.8135 key resistance will reveal which case it is. Rejection by 0.8135 key resistance, followed by firm break of 0.7413 resistance turned support, will favors the latter case. Deeper decline would be seen to 38.2% retracement of 0.5506 to 0.8006 at 0.7051 first.\n\nIn the longer term picture, 0.5506 is a long term bottom, on bullish convergence condition in monthly MACD. Focus is now back on 0.8135 structural resistance. Decisive break there will raise the chance that rise from 0.5506 is an impulsive up trend. Next target should be 61.8% retracement at 0.8950 of 1.1079 to 0.5506 and above. Though, rejection by 0.8135 will keep the case of medium to long term sideway consolidation open."}, {"headline": "G10 FX Week Ahead: The last fireworks", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "MENAFN.COM", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2021-07/02/I_ee2a1image_story.jpg", "author": [], "body": "G10 FX Week Ahead: The last fireworks\n\n\n\n(MENAFN - ING) DXY: Dollar bulls book profits ahead of Independence Day Spot Week ahead bias Range next week 1 month target DXY 92.5220 Mildly Bullish 92.0000 - 93.0000 92.5000 The dollar has enjoyed a strong start to July and a healthy June nonfarm payrolls release should keep the dollar bid against the low yielders at least. Though the unemployment rate was higher than expected, progress in jobs gains will be welcomed by the Federal Reserve and likely to keep US money market rates biased towards a 2022 rate hike. The sluggish dollar performance on Friday probably owed to profit-taking ahead of the Independence Day holiday and some large FX option expiries.\n\nUS trading will likely be quiet in a shortened holiday week. The calendar is quite light, with the highlight probably being the release of the FOMC minutes on Wednesday evening. Much focus will be given to how the doves and hawks are arguing their cases \u2013 especially the seven members casting their Dots for the first rate hike in 2022. Internationally, the focus will be on whether the G20 on Friday formally signs off on new global minimum tax standards. We\u2019ll also be interested in Chinese Caixin PMI readings (Wednesday) and inflation readings (Friday). On the latter, investors will examine whether there remains a gulf between the PPI and CPI (9% YoY versus 1.3% respectively), meaning that Chinese policy makers will do their utmost to limit input prices. EUR: Time for some better hard data in Europe Spot Week ahead bias Range next week 1 month target EUR/USD 1.1837 Mildly Bearish 1.1740 - 1.1900 1.1900 EUR/USD remains fragile and the better-than-expected NFP headline number will keep open the possibility of a drop to 1.1700. Expect the FOMC minutes on Wednesday to have a big say in how low EUR/USD goes this coming week.\n\nFor the week ahead, the European data calendar is very light, with focus on more investor confidence surveys (Sentix Monday, ZEW Tuesday) and on Wednesday the release of the European Commission\u2019s summer forecast round. These presumably should see growth upgrades. Germany will on Wednesday see May industrial production \u2013 expected to rebound in line with the better sentiment indicators. Some improvement in the hard data could provide the euro with a little support. JPY: More big gains for the GPIF Spot Week ahead bias Range next week 1 month target USD/JPY 111.36 Mildly Bullish 110.80 - 112.20 111.00 USD/JPY looks to be taking a breather ahead of multi-year resistance around the 112.20/40 area. It is hard to see US rates coming off too sharply from current levels and USD/JPY may well have built a new floor in the 110.40 area. There may not be enough in the calendar to drive USD/JPY through 112.20/40 in the week ahead \u2013 but it should stay reasonably well bid.\n\nLast week we were focusing on the release of the GPIF annual report and indeed it was very impressive, returning 25% in the Japanese fiscal year to March 21. Portfolio allocation for the world\u2019s largest pension fund is always a hot topic and there were some quite big changes in the quarter to March. Foreign bond holdings were cut to 24.6% from 25.7% (was the GPIF behind the 1Q US Treasury sell-off?), while both foreign and domestic equity allocations were cut below the 25% benchmark. The big winners were Domestic Bonds, increasing to 25.9% from 23.6% - a more conservative stance from the GPIF. GBP: Still unfussed by the Delta variant spread Spot Week ahead bias Range next week 1 month target GBP/USD 1.3777 Neutral 1.3700 - 1.3850 1.4100 It\u2019s been a rather eventful week for the pound. The EU granted a delay to the chilled meat ban in Northern Ireland, temporarily calming market concerns about an escalation in trade tensions. Still, it appears that strong political divergences persist and the risk of a new round of tough EU-UK trade negotiations later in the year is very high. Domestically, the Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey warned against overreacting to\u201ctemporary\u201d inflationary pressures, prompting some re-pricing in tightening expectations.\n\nOverall, the pound has held up better than most of its G10 peers to the dollar\u2019s appreciating trend, which also denotes how the market continues to see the recent sharp rise in Delta variant cases in the UK as unlikely to derail the country\u2019s economic recovery. Our UK economist explores this topic in this article. In the week ahead, data releases should not be the main drivers, and focus will likely be on another speech by Andrew Bailey as well as any headlines from Angela Merkel\u2019s visit to the UK today. As long as the UK government does not suggest that the rise in cases will postpone the reopening further, there are few reasons for the market to turn more bearish on the pound compared to other G10 peers.\n\nAUD: We don't expect a material hawkish shift by the RBA Spot Week ahead bias Range next week 1 month target AUD/USD 0.7488 Mildly Bearish 0.7380 - 0.7520 0.7600 The Aussie dollar was one of the main victims of the dollar rally this week, dropping in line with most pro-cyclical currencies. Now the focus shifts to the pivotal Reserve Bank of Australia meeting on Tuesday.\n\nBased on recent communications by the RBA governor, there are four main options for the Bank as it is set to re-adjust its quantitative easing: 1) ceasing asset purchases, 2) repeating A$100bn asset purchase scheme for six months and then reviewing, 3) conducting a smaller amount (like A$50bn) of purchases for six months and then reviewing, 4) repeating A$100bn for a longer period than six months. We expect the RBA to go for the second option, which would allow them to steer away from the tapering narrative while adopting a more data-dependent approach. If anything, we see option three as the second most likely, although that would likely be seen by markets as a hawkish shift. We think market pricing is standing somewhere between option two and three, which means that if our base case materialises (A$100bn for six months) the impact on the Australian dollar could be negative. More crucially, we think the RBA will not follow other developed central banks in signalling a rate hike in 2022, and markets may be forced to re-price some of their hawkish expectations, which could also put pressure on AUD. NZD: Quiet calendar before 15 July RBNZ meeting Spot Week ahead bias Range next week 1 month target NZD/USD 0.7000 Mildly Bullish 0.6940 - 0.7050 0.7200 The Kiwi dollar continues to follow global trends due to a lack of domestic catalysts. This will continue to be the case next week as there are no data releases worth noting in New Zealand until the 15 July central bank meeting.\n\nA domestic development we still want to highlight is the resilience in housing prices. CoreLogic data showed a 22.8% year-on-year increase in prices in June, up from 20.5% in May. The inability of government measures to effectively curb the housing bubble in New Zealand is one factor that, in our view, continues to argue in favour of an earlier than expected tightening. CAD: Time to jump back on the Canadian horse? Spot Week ahead bias Range next week 1 month target USD/CAD 1.2372 Neutral 1.2260 - 1.2430 1.2200 USD/CAD has witnessed a classic short squeeze. Like fellow commodity currencies, the toxic cocktail of Fed hawkishness and Chinese commodity intervention has taken its toll on heavily-backed trades. Yet it looks like the Bank of Canada will be well ahead of the Fed in tightening policy and now that the majority of the correction is over, speculators will be looking to reset CAD longs. The 100-day moving average at 1.2430 may be the area to try this.\n\nCanada\u2019s data calendar is light in the coming week \u2013 just April retail sales which are expected to fall 5% month-on-month with Canada in lockdown. We will also see the June release for the CFIB business barometer \u2013 which may well retest the highs at 68.2. CHF: FX transaction data shows the SNB stepping away in 1Q Spot Week ahead bias Range next week 1 month target EUR/CHF 1.0941 Mildly Bullish 1.0930 - 1.0990 1.1000 Data released this last week shows that the Swiss National Bank significantly scaled back its FX intervention in 1Q21 to just CHF296mn. That compares to peak intervention of CHF51bn in 2Q last year. The news was consistent with the SNB CHF sight deposit data and made sense since EUR/CHF was really rallying on its own accord in 1Q21. The same may not be said for 2Q21, however, where EUR/CHF has been under pressure and CHF sight deposit data may imply that the SNB could have intervened to the tune of CHF10bn again to keep EUR/CHF supported.\n\nThere are few standouts in the Swiss calendar in the week ahead, but June FX reserve data released on the 7th could be interesting and add weight to the idea that the SNB did intervene more when EUR/CHF traded under 1.09. Assuming that eurozone hard data delivers on the bullish soft data this summer, we expect EUR/CHF to be trading well above 1.10 ahead of what is shaping up to be an important European Central Bank meeting in early September. NOK: Emerging as an attractive buy-the-dip option Spot Week ahead bias Range next week 1 month target EUR/NOK 10.2300 Neutral 10.1200 - 10.2800 10.1000 The Norwegian krone has been the worst performer this week, largely due to the fact that it has the highest beta to risk sentiment among all G10 currencies.\n\nHigher oil prices have so far been unable to counter other external negative factors, but once risk sentiment stabilises, Norway's krone may emerge as one of the most attractive buy-the-dip options in the G10. Much will depend on developments at the OPEC+ meeting (we discussed this in the CAD section), but NOK can also count on one of the most hawkish central banks in the developed world, which should allow it to benefit from a search for carry. Next week, inflation data for June will take centre stage, with the headline CPI set to approach levels close to 3%. This should further endorse the Norges Bank\u2019s hawkish stance and offer some support for a recovery in NOK. SEK: Riksbank's lower-for-longer to keep appetite low for SEK Spot Week ahead bias Range next week 1 month target EUR/SEK 10.1600 Neutral 10.1100 - 10.2000 10.1500 Despite being normally less vulnerable to negative turns in risk sentiment, Sweden's krona has come under a good deal of pressure this week. The Riksbank\u2019s rate announcement this week was largely a non-event for SEK, as the Bank reiterated that it will not deviate from its dovish tone anytime soon, despite showing some hints of optimism in its economic outlook (here\u2019s our economist's review of the meeting ).\n\nNext week will be very quiet data-wise in Sweden, and should any rebound in activity currencies materialise, we continue to expect SEK to be a laggard as the markets may be inclined to reward currencies (like NOK) that are backed by hawkish central banks.

The currency pair bounced back slightly in the afternoon session in an attempt to return to the normal trading zone of the 14-hour RSI. It remains in overbought conditions.\n\nThe pair also dropped several levels below the 100-hour moving average in the 60-min chart after breaking out of the slightly ascending channel formation.\n\nEUR/CHF Fundamentals Overview\n\nFrom a fundamental perspective, the EUR/CHF currency pair is trading at the back of a relatively busy period in the Eu market. On Thursday, the German retail sales data for May missed the expected (MoM) change of 5% with 4.2%. The (YoY) equivalent also disappointed with a change of -2.4% compared to the expectation of 10.1%. Germany\u2019s Markit Manufacturing PMI for June outshone the expectation of 64.9 with 65.1 while the EU unemployment rate for May fell to 7.9% down from 8.1% in the previous month, beating the expectation of 8%.\n\nEarlier in the week, the preliminary EU CPI for June matched the expected (core) and (general) changes of 0.9% and 1.9%, respectively. In Switzerland, the KOF leading indicator for June missed 144.7 with 133.4 while May retail sales grew 2.8% (MoM) compared to a 37.7% decline in the previous period.\n\nEUR/CHF Technical Analysis (the 60-min Chart)\n\nTechnically, the EUR/CHF currency pair appears to have recently plunged to break out of an ascending channel formation. The pair is now in oversold conditions in the 14-hour RSI. It also trades several levels below the 100-hour moving average, creating an opportunity for a rebound.\n\nThe bulls will target short-term rebound profits at around 1.0956 or higher at 1.0971.

The Issuer and Meyer Burger have agreed to a 180-day lock-up period after the listing of the New Shares and the issuance of the Bonds, subject to waiver by the syndicate banks and customary exceptions. Share Placement\n\nMeyer Burger targeted to achieve gross proceeds of CHF 80 million from the placement of the New Shares, which was successfully completed. The shares were placed at CHF 0.515 per share, corresponding to a discount of approximately 4% on the Volume Weighted Average Price ('VWAP') over the last five trading days.

Unless previously converted or repurchased and cancelled, the Bonds will be redeemed at 100% of their principal amount on July 8, 2027. The Bonds will initially be convertible into approximately 247 million registered shares of Meyer Burger, sourced from shares to be newly issued from conditional share capital excluding the existing shareholders' advance subscription rights. The initial conversion price has been set at EUR 0.5868, representing a premium of 25% over the issue price of the New Shares translated into EUR using the EUR:CHF foreign exchange rate at the time of pricing.\n\n\n\nMeyer Burger will be entitled to redeem the Bonds at their principal amount plus accrued interest in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Bonds at any time (i) on or after July 29, 2025, if the price of a Meyer Burger share is equal to or exceeds 130% of the then prevailing conversion price over a certain period or (ii) if less than 15% of the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds remain outstanding. The settlement and payment date of the Bonds is expected to be on or around July 8, 2021.

GBP/USD and USD/CAD's relationship defines currency markets due not only to USD Vs Non-USD but many currency pairs factor against this relationship.\n\nFor example, GBP/USD minus USD/CHF equates to CHF/JPY, and USD/CAD minus USD/CHF equals EUR/CHF and AUD/NZD. By trading exchange rates by exchange rates by use of a calculator, found is a support or resistance point or entry and target.\n\nEUR/JPY is clearly the leader to JPY cross pairs as known from most widely traded currency in 3 years Triennial Surveys dating to 2001.

Given that we see an uptrend on the 20 hourly candle timeframe, and that such candlestick patterns often denote reversals, this may be worth noting.

The bulk of the USD short squeeze took place against the Euro and the Pound as net longs were slashed by $4.3bln (4.2% of OI) and $1.2bln (10% of OI ) respectively. The sell-off much more pronounced in the Pound given the stretched net long positioning. What\u2019s more, recent pushback by the BoE of premature tightening, provided another hit to GBP bulls (likely shown in the next update). That said, positioning remains an issue for GBP, albeit less so, leaving the currency vulnerable to sharp pullbacks, should risk sentiment soften.\n\nAcross the rest of the G10 space saw modest increases in net longs (on an OI adjusted basis) against the USD. A marginal pick up in CAD and AUD net longs, which is somewhat reflective of the price action seen last week and potentially indicative of summer trading conditions with speculators seeking pro-cyclical currencies vs low yielders. Regarding the Canadian Dollar with BoC tightening well priced into the currency, coupled with the fact that positioning is stretched (97% rank), the Loonie may underperform vs AUD, which will play catch up provided the RBA brings forward rate hike expectations to 2023 from 2024.\n\nElsewhere, the Swiss Franc had been in demand, particularly among leveraged accounts (fast money). Although, in light of the Fed\u2019s pivot and with the SNB remaining very accommodative, risks look to be asymmetrically tilted to the upside in USD/CHF. While high-beta currencies may also perform well against CHF (AUD/CHF and NZD/CHF).\n\nWeekly FX Positioning\n\nSource: CFTC, DailyFX (Covers up to June 22nd, released June 25th)\n\nThe Analytical

The pair rejected 1.4240-50 yet again, making it look increasingly like a double top. A sharp deceleration in the Pound following a hawkish twist by the Federal Reserve has made positioning in GBP somewhat cleaner with longs liquidated. However, this point is variable for the Pound, particularly with monetary policy tightening and a strong UK economic outlook very much reflected in the price (OIS markets price BoE hike in Q3 22). As such, it would take a move below 1.3800 to gain momentum towards the 200DMA (1.3622), where buyers are likely to sit in waiting from 1.3670 (Mar-Apr double bottom). On the flip side, the pivotal 1.40 handle may act to cap the upside, making it the first target for bulls to overcome. Should Cable break above the even figure the worst of the struggle in the second and third quarters may be past. That said, Q3 is likely to be a much choppier affair with FX markets experiencing heightened sensitivity to economic data. As it stands, risks are more geared towards dips to 1.3670 and 1.3622 rather than a break of the Feb/June peak where we are more likely to meet firm demand.\n\nGBP/USD Daily Chart\n\nEUR/GBP Consolidation Persisting, ECB/BOE Outlook to Provide Direction\n\nIn Q2, EUR/GBP recorded its smallest range since Q1 2014 (249pip range) \u2013 brilliant for range traders, but a quarter to forget for most. However, if you are hoping for an exciting Q3 in EUR/GBP, you may be left disappointed. Q2 had kicked off with a false break below 0.8500 and the subsequent countertrend rally has meant that the cross has not looked back since. Rising trendline support from two major lows (the 2020 low and 2021 low) looks to keep the 0.8500 handle protected. In turn, bullish interests are likely to struggle to cross the mid-0.86s, leaving EUR/GBP more likely to consolidate a while longer. For sparks, two focal points to take note of over the quarter will be the BoE\u2019s August MPR and ECB\u2019s strategy review, either of which could provide a clearer sense of direction.\n\nEUR/GBP Daily Chart\n\nMake or Break for GBP/JPY\n\nGBP/JPY: A chart to watch in Q3 will be GBP/JPY, which could face a make or break moment in the grander timescale. The multi-decade trendline drawn from the 2007 and 2015 peaks had managed to cap bullish ambitions through the end of the year\u2019s first half. It is possible that with the BoE closer to policy normalisation than the Bank of Japan (BOJ), a hawkish pivot would likely be enough to underpin GBP versus this and low yielders.\n\nGBP/JPY Monthly Chart\n\nTo read the full equity forecast, including the fundamental outlook, download our new 3Q trading guide from the DailyFX Free Trading Guides!"}, {"headline": "European Monetary Union CFTC EUR NC Net Positions declined to \u20ac87.1K from previous \u20ac89.1K", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://staticcontent.fxstreet.com/website/static-html/favicon.ico", "author": [], "body": "Information on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

However a close above the trendline could make for an interesting start to next week\u2019s trading as 14.50 would become the next psychologically important level to assess a potential long term reversal.\n\nUSD/ZAR Daily Chart\n\nChart prepared by Richard Snow, IG\n\nGBP/ZAR\n\nGBP/ZAR followed much of the recent USD/ZAR price action and witnessed a move higher off the recent low. However, the ascending channel has been contained by the psychological level of 20.00 and today showed another strong rejection off this level as well as the 100 SMA. A break below the ascending channel and the 19.50 level could indicate a greater pullback of the recent bullish price action.\n\nGBP/ZAR Daily Chart\n\nChart prepared by Richard Snow, IG\n\nEUR/ZAR\n\nYesterday the EUR/ZAR pair threatened to break above its long-term trendline for the first time since March this year and did so again today (blue circle). However, price action started to drop lower in the lead up to the NFP to trade below the 17.00 level. 16.70 is the next level of support if the pullback is set to continue. A break above the long-term trendline and move towards 17.50 are required before considering any potential change in the long-term trend\n\nEUR/ZAR Daily Chart\n\nChart prepared by Richard Snow, IG\n\n{{GUIDE|BUILDING_CONFIDENCE_IN_TRADING|Never underestimate the psychological aspect of trading\n\n--- Written by Richard Snow for DailyFX.com\n\nContact and follow Richard on Twitter: @RichardSnowFX"}, {"headline": "Sunflower Lecithin Market Research Report by Function, by Form, by Source, by Industry, by Distribution Mode, by Region - Global Forecast to 2026 - Cumulative Impact of COVID-19", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Yahoo Finance", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/IN3_pUboxxFTZlP4bjcjcQ--~B/aD00MDA7dz00MDA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/globenewswire.com/4ce8962afb8a41766b626a7e61c8413f", "author": [], "body": "Sunflower Lecithin Market Research Report by Function (Antioxidants, Dispersant, and Emulsifier), by Form (Liquide and Powder), by Source, by Industry, by Distribution Mode, by Region (Americas, Asia-Pacific, and Europe, Middle East & Africa) - Global Forecast to 2026 - Cumulative Impact of COVID-19\n\nNew York, July 02, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reportlinker.com announces the release of the report \"Sunflower Lecithin Market Research Report by Function, by Form, by Source, by Industry, by Distribution Mode, by Region - Global Forecast to 2026 - Cumulative Impact of COVID-19\" - https://www.reportlinker.com/p06088181/?utm_source=GNW\n\n\n\nThe Global Sunflower Lecithin Market size was estimated at USD 382.79 Million in 2020 and expected to reach USD 426.77 Million in 2021, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) 11.82% from 2020 to 2026 to reach USD 748.59 Million by 2026.\n\n\n\nMarket Statistics:\n\nThe report provides market sizing and forecast across five major currencies - USD, EUR GBP, JPY, and AUD.

USD/CAD is the outlier and not only doing fine but USD/CAD can travel much higher easily while USD/CHF and worthless USD/JPY cannot.\n\nUSD/JPY at current levels is not supported by averages dating to 1999 to offer the degree of overbought and potential downside and overbought also offers the potential downside to JPY cross pairs. Overall JPY cross pairs for months traded 200 pip ranges and doing nothing.\n\nUSD/CHF at current 0.9274 and severely overbought Vs DXY 92.67 must inform DXY is as overbought at USD/CHF. Currency markets are in dire need of a correction before consideration to further downside.\n\nUSD/JPY traded to 111.59 highs by the day trade 10 AM hour yesterday and located between 111.43 and 111.71 from 111.10 lows or 49 measly pips. Since 111.59, USD/JPY traded 5 pips higher in 14 traded hours. Much better pairs exist than to trade USD/JPY.\n\nEUR/USD yesterday before the 10 AM hour traded to 1.1883 highs from 1.1837 lows or 46 pips and located from 1.1868 to 1.1890. Since yesterday's 1.1837 lows, EUR/USD traded to 1.1821 or 16 pips in 16 traded hours.\n\nEUR/JPY traded to `132.46 highs and exceeded 132.25 day trade tops. What a free money bonus. EUR/JPY then traded to 132.19 lows or 27 pips. For the week, EUR/JPY traded 131.28 to 132.46 or 118 pips or 23 pips per day.\n\nThe question to day trades is not what traded previously but what didn't trade as prices are trading barely 50 pips in 24 hours of trade. EUR/USD and USD/CHF travel barely 300 pips in weeks only to find severe oversold asnd overbought. Prices trade to intervals rather than trade to the average. What a tragedy exists these days in markets.\n\nSo 50 pips and no reaction on Fed speakers, News events nor anything else that hit markets over the past 24 hours. News events, Fed speakers and whatever else to market events was taken out of the equation to day trades by central banks by killing interest rate markets to non movements.\n\nDay trade profits were once easily 50 ish pips per currency and 9 currency pairs traded for a total of 450 possible pips. Today against 25 pips on 9 currency pairs only 225 pips are available to trade. Central banks cut market trading by 1/2.\n\nPrevious, 50 pips were earned quickly, in minutes and today, maybe 24 hours.\n\nDoesn't matter today what NFP reveals as day trade prices will trade.\n\nSame story as yesterday, EUR/USD, AUD/USD, NZD/USD and now GBP/USD trade deep oversold and shorts are impossible. Same story to USD/JPY and USD/CHF as longs are impossible. Longs are impossible to JPY cross pairs.\n\nA serious correction is required before prices can travel safely again and weekly trades become normal.\n\nEUR/USD 5 vital numbers today: 1.1777, 1.1789, 1.1801, 1.1867 and 1.1898. Overall, EUR/USD must travel far higher than 1.1898 to become normal again.\n\nUSD/JPY 5 vital numbers today: 111.03, 111.14, 111.15, 111.87, 112.14. Overall, USD/JPY must trade much lower than 111.03 to become normal again.\n\nEUR/JPY 5 vital numbers: 131.43, 131.56, 131.79, 132.44, 132.77.\n\nHere's a guide to what is traded in currency markets as the smallest price of all traded financial instruments.

to keep strengthening", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "FXStreet", "date": "49 mins ago", "image":

lower lows in the days ahead. The daily chart shows that sellers surged around a critical Fibonacci resistance around 1.1920, while the pair reached lower lows and lower highs for five consecutive days. The 20 SMA heads firmly lower, crossing below the longer ones, a sign of persistent weakness, while technical indicators consolidate near oversold readings. Near-term technical readings reflect the latest bounce, but given that moving averages maintain their bearish slopes in the 4-hour chart, the risk remains skewed to the downside.\n\nAt the beginning of the week, the US will celebrate Independence day, with all local markets closed on Monday. During the European session, Markit will publish the final versions of its Services and Composite PMIs for the Union, while the EU will release July Sentix Investor Confidence, foreseen at 30 from 28.1 in the previous month.\n\nThe EUR/USD pair trimmed part of its weekly losses on Friday, ending the week in the red at 1.1866 after bottoming at 1.1806 a three-month low. The greenback surged after the release of the June US Nonfarm Payrolls report, which showed that the country added 860,000 jobs in the month, beating expectations. However, the Unemployment Rate jumped to 5.9% vs the 5.7% expected, while the Labor Force Participation Rate stayed unchanged at 61.6%. The report was good enough to send stocks higher and government bond yields lower, fueling the risk-on mood that dominated the final session of the week.\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

There was a rush of excitement around the FOMC rate decision a couple of weeks ago and after the bullish drive in the USD, the NFP report was widely-watched for signs of strength in the US economy. And while the headline number beat, an unexpected climb in the unemployment rate buffered the excitement from the print and helped to remove a bit of pressure from the Greenback after the currency set a fresh two-month-high.\n\nAt this point, the Fed has offered only subtle signaling via the dot plot matrix, indicating a possible two rate hikes in 2023. But, given how loose monetary policy has been and just how much capital is levered on the prospect of low rates staying that way, the simple sign that this may not continue for long can be enough to provoke a shot of volatility.\n\nFor now, however, the Fed appears to be in the relative clear as they delivered their message and offered this signal without creating significant damage in risk markets. The next major FOMC outing is a little later in the summer, with the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium. And after that, the September FOMC rate decision is the next opportunity for the bank to share updated forecasts and projections, and if inflation has turned out to be more than transitory, this is likely the spot that the Federal Reserve will use to share their plans for countering that impact.\n\nGiven this backdrop, the potential for mean reversion and range-bound conditions remains high. As of this writing, the Fourth of July holiday is ahead in the United States and this will bring a lower-liquidity backdrop across many markets. Below, I look at a few setups around the US Dollar with a longer-term focus in mind, looking for themes of interest as we trade deeper into Q2.\n\nAnd if you want to see more trade ideas, DailyFX has just published our Top Trades for Q3, which you can access in full from the link below:\n\nUS Dollar\n\nThe USD perched up to a fresh two-month-high on the morning of NFP. But, once the details of the report were incorporated into price action, prices fell back down towards a support spot at prior resistance. This plots around 92.46 and there\u2019s two 23.6% Fibonacci retracements in tight proximity (one from the 2020-2021 sell-off and another from the Q1, 2021 bullish bounce). This couldn\u2019t hold through Friday trade and prices slipped down to another spot of support, plotted around 91.19-92.26.\n\nSitting atop price action is some unfilled gap running up to around 92.89, and this could be an initial resistance level to follow for bullish continuation scenarios. As I shared in the webinar on Tuesday, given the combination of technical and fundamental backdrops, my near-term bias here remains bullish.\n\nTo learn more about Fibonacci, check out DailyFX Education\n\nUS Dollar Daily Price Chart\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USD, DXY on Tradingview\n\nIf the current zone of Fibonacci support cannot hold, there\u2019s another area of possible support around 91.82-91.93. If price breaks below the double-bottom at 91.51, then the bullish theme comes into question.\n\nUS Dollar Four-Hour Price Chart\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USD, DXY on Tradingview\n\nEUR/USD\n\nOn that topic of mean reversion, that\u2019s basically describing the first half of 2021 in EUR/USD. After a stark sell-off in Q1 found support, Q2 saw more than 80% of that move clawed back. But after resistance played-in around 1.2250, sellers came back, helped along by that surge of USD-strength, and prices in EUR/USD started to push right back towards the support batch around the 1.1700-handle.\n\nEUR/USD Daily Price Chart\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; EURUSD on Tradingview\n\nOn a shorter-term basis, this pair remains an option for USD-strength scenarios, with a similar albeit mirror image backdrop of the US Dollar. After a visit to resistance in the 1965-2000 zone, sellers were on the prowl this week to push in a fresh two-month-low in the pair. Prices crossed a big spot of prior support around the 1.1850 level, and after the Friday NFP release, prices pushed back above this spot; yet remain below the prior lower-high from around 1.1885.\n\nA hold below the 1.1885-1.1900 zone can keep the door open for bearish scenarios in the pair, targeting a re-test of the 2021 lows which, at this point, can be classified as range support in the EUR/USD, at least until it\u2019s broken.\n\nEUR/USD Four-Hour Price Chart\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; EURUSD on Tradingview\n\nGBP/USD\n\nGBP/USD remains interesting as it was one of the stronger major pairs ahead of the FOMC\u2019s rate decision a couple weeks ago. But, as the theme of USD strength drove in the aftermath of that meeting, GBP/USD plunged down to fresh lows along with a number of other major pairs.\n\nThe big area of nearby support in GBP/USD plots from around 1.3644-1.3678. This is a confluent zone of Fibonacci retracement levels that caught support inflections in March and April of this year after helping to set resistance in January, around the yearly open. A test here can open the door for bullish setups, looking for mean reversion themes to remain.\n\nGBP/USD Daily Price Chart\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; GBPUSD on Tradingview\n\nUSD/CAD Returns to Big Support Zone\n\nI had looked into USD/CAD earlier in the week, plotting a short-term range after a bounce from a key zone of support. But the NFP impact to the USD caused prices to breach support in the short-term range, with prices driving all the way down to the longer-term support zone plotted from 1.2250-1.2300.\n\nThis keeps the door open for bullish scenarios should this support zone hold through the open next week.\n\nUSD/CAD Four-Hour Price Chart\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USDCAD on Tradingview\n\nUSD/JPY Pullback to Support at Prior Resistance\n\nAnother setup that could remain amenable for near-term USD strength in USD/JPY. The pair similarly saw pullback around the NFP report, with prices quickly returning to a Fibonacci level just below the 111.00 handle. This same level had previously helped to set resistance in the pair and after the breakout ran up to another Fibonacci level earlier this week, prices have returned to that inflection point and this can keep the door open for themes of bullish continuation.\n\nUSD/JPY Four-Hour Price Chart\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; USDJPY on Tradingview\n\n--- Written by James Stanley, Senior Strategist for DailyFX.com\n\nContact and follow James on Twitter: @JStanleyFX"}, {"headline": "EUR/USD Weekly Price Forecast \u2013 Euro Threatening to Break Down", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "Yahoo Finance", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zIokcPveXqepbvEmLs2bRA--~B/aD00MTA7dz02MTU7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/9c0053726c6493988b3f9ea6ab18b040", "author": ["Christopher Lewis"], "body": "The Euro has fallen during the course of the trading week to break down below the 1.1850 level, an area that of course has been important a couple of times in the past.

If for no other reason, people start buying treasuries to protect their accounts.\n\nIt is not until we take out the one point to zero level that I would be convinced of any type of recovery, at least as things stand right now. Nonetheless, the market continues to be very noisy in general, so I do think what we are looking at is more chop than anything else.

If we break down below the candlestick on Friday, then that could open up massive selling in this market to go much lower.\n\nEUR/USD Video 05.07.21\n\nIf we do, then it is likely that we go looking towards the 1.17 level, followed by the 1.16 level. The 1.16 level is an area that is massively important on longer-term charts, so I would anticipate that we would see a lot of noise in that area. If we were to somehow break down below there, then the market really starts to fall apart. This would almost certainly be a major \u201crisk off event\u201d reaction and therefore the headlines would be relatively obvious.\n\nTo the upside if we were to suddenly take out the shooting stars near the 200 day EMA, the market could start to take off again, especially if we can jump above the 1.20 handle. If that is an area that we get above, then it is likely that we could see this market really start to take out. Nonetheless, the market is about to make some type of decision, but we are clearly just jumping around this larger consolidation area that people are looking at.

While Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin provided the dovish counterbalance, it seems that the hawkish camp is growing larger. That implies a higher chance that the bank reduced its bond-buying scheme sooner rather than later. Overall, Waller provided some support to the dollar.\n\nDelta dark clouds: After spreading rapidly through Britain, it seems that the Delta coronavirus variant is making its way through Europe and threatening to inflict economic damage. While the old continent is vaccinating its population rapidly, the quick contagion has been causing an uptick in cases weighing on the euro.\n\nInfections have stopped falling in some European countries:\n\nSource: FT\n\nAnother drag on the common currency came from eurozone inflation figures. The headline Consumer Price Index dropped to 1.9% YoY, while Core CPI slid to 0.9%. That is a stark difference with 3.4% in the US, according to the Fed's preferred gauge of underlying prices.\n\nUS President Joe Biden has yet to translate his bipartisan agreement on infrastructure spending into legislation.

Moreover, it is unclear if the elevated doses delivered to Europe will continue in July at the same pace as June. These charts may impact the euro.\n\nSource: FT\n\nThe economic calendar kicks off with final Services PMIs, which will likely continue showing an upbeat sentiment about the recovery. Another business survey is eyed on Tuesday \u2013 the German ZEW Business Climate figure. Retail sales data for May is set to show a rapid recovery, especially compared to the same month in 2020.\n\nMarkets will likely await an upgrade from economic growth forecasts from the European Commission. America's stimulus and Europe's reopening have probably outweighed the more recent variant worries.\n\nThe biggest known unknown on the economic calendar is the European Central Bank's special strategy meeting set to conclude on Thursday. Will the Frankfurt-based institution allow for higher inflation like the Fed? Will it move to focus on Core CPI?\n\nSuch moves could weigh on the euro. Former ECB President Mario Draghi \u2013 now Prime Minister of Italy \u2013 has recently expressed his support for looser monetary policy \u2013 and he may still have influence. However, if the bank refrains from making any changes to lack of consensus, the common currency would have more breathing room.\n\nHere are the events lined up in the Eurozone on the forex calendar:\n\nUS events: Fed minutes and ISM survey in focus\n\nPresident Biden aimed to reach 70% of adults with one dose by Independence Day \u2013 July 4. However, it has already become clear that the target will be missed. While coronavirus cases continue falling in America, there is always a fear of the Delta variant. Inoculating more people is critical to keep the economy running, yet the immunization campaign has substantially slowed.\n\nAn uptick in this chart, breaking the downtrend, would be positive for markets and the dollar.\n\nSource: New York Times\n\nDrafting the infrastructure bill is set to resume in Washington, yet the chances for an urgent rush to pass legislation remain low.\n\nEchoes from Friday's Nonfarm Payrolls will likely move markets early in the week while Americans enjoy their long weekend. Additional analysis could sway investors to change their positions. On Tuesday, the stage belongs to the ISM Services PMI statistics for June, set to soften from the elevated level of 64 recorded in May.\n\nWhile the employment component in ISM's report is somewhat stale after the NFP, the Prices Paid figure is relevant to the Fed's assessment of inflation expectations.\n\nThe central bank is in focus on Wednesday, with the publication of its meeting minutes from June. That event marked an inflection point for the dollar, as the Fed shocked markets with a hawkish shift. The dot plot signaled two interest rate hikes in 2023, and Chair Jerome Powell went further by saying that the debate about tapering bond-buying is kicking off.\n\nWill the minutes counter that hawkishness with some nuance? That could weigh on the greenback. Conversely, the protocols could also show that those calling to scale back support for the economy were louder than perceived in June. In such a case, the greenback could gain ground.\n\nHere are the scheduled events in the US:\n\nEUR/USD technical analysis\n\nEuro/dollar is nearing oversold conditions as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is showing. If the RSI dips below 30, the pair could correct upward. Other indicators as momentum and the 50-day, 100-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages all point to a downtrend in the bigger scheme of things.\n\nSupport awaits at the early July low of 1.1835, followed by 1.1760, a cushion back in late March. The round 1.17 level \u2013 EUR/USD launch point in 1999 \u2013 is the next line to watch.\n\nResistance is at 1.1910, a support line from late June. It is followed by 1.1970, the post-Fed crash recovery peak. A stubborn cap awaits at 1.20, which is not only a psychological barrier but also a support line from May and where the 200-day SMA hits the price.\n\nEUR/USD sentiment\n\nThe Fed's minutes may serve as a reminder of the bank's hawkish twist, which could counter a dovish shift from the ECB. The spread of the Delta variant across Europe could also weigh on the euro. Overall, there is room for more falls.\n\nThe FXStreet Poll is pointing to an imminent dip below 1.18 \u2013 an extension of the past weeks' decline, before a robust recovery later on.

However a close above the trendline could make for an interesting start to next week\u2019s trading as 14.50 would become the next psychologically important level to assess a potential long term reversal.\n\nUSD/ZAR Daily Chart\n\nChart prepared by Richard Snow, IG\n\nGBP/ZAR\n\nGBP/ZAR followed much of the recent USD/ZAR price action and witnessed a move higher off the recent low. However, the ascending channel has been contained by the psychological level of 20.00 and today showed another strong rejection off this level as well as the 100 SMA. A break below the ascending channel and the 19.50 level could indicate a greater pullback of the recent bullish price action.\n\nGBP/ZAR Daily Chart\n\nChart prepared by Richard Snow, IG\n\nEUR/ZAR\n\nYesterday the EUR/ZAR pair threatened to break above its long-term trendline for the first time since March this year and did so again today (blue circle). However, price action started to drop lower in the lead up to the NFP to trade below the 17.00 level. 16.70 is the next level of support if the pullback is set to continue. A break above the long-term trendline and move towards 17.50 are required before considering any potential change in the long-term trend\n\nEUR/ZAR Daily Chart\n\nChart prepared by Richard Snow,

"https://cyprus-mail.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/euro-5094284_1280.jpg", "author": ["Cm Guest Columnist"], "body": "Many people know they can receive Bitcoin payments by getting a digital wallet. Others know even how to purchase Bitcoins via crypto exchanges. However, some individuals don\u2019t know how to convert their Bitcoins into cash or local currency.\n\nWell, you can convert your Bitcoins in different ways. Even if you want to hold onto your Bitcoins and sell them after several years, you might want to know ways to convert them into cash. Here are ways to turn this virtual currency into fiat money.\n\nUse a Cryptocurrency Exchange\n\nA crypto exchange like the News Spy perhaps provides the easiest way to cash out Bitcoins. Such platforms allow users to sell their Bitcoins to other users. Thus, you can exchange your Bitcoin for EUR, USD, MYR, GBP, or any other fiat currency. These apps are user-friendly and easily accessible. First, however, select a crypto exchange that supports users in your country.\n\nSign up with a crypto exchange and complete your verification process. After that, deposit Bitcoins or purchase them and then cash out to fiat money via PayPal or bank transfer. While this method is secure and easy, it can take several days. Also, not every country has crypto exchanges. That means it might not be a good option for everybody.\n\nUse P2P Bitcoin Exchanges\n\nYou can find peer-to-peer Bitcoin exchanges that allow people to purchase and sell Bitcoin online. Essentially, these platforms facilitate direct Bitcoin trading between sellers and buyers. That means you don\u2019t involve intermediaries in your trade. Instead, you deal with a Bitcoin buyer directly. What\u2019s more, you can use the escrow service to safeguard your Bitcoins. Additionally, you decide the amount to accept for your Bitcoin and your preferred payment method.\n\nWhile you may trade directly with another person offline, using a P2P platform ensures your safety. That\u2019s because you use the escrow service that can resolve a dispute and mediate transactions if necessary.\n\nUse a Bitcoin ATM\n\nPerhaps, you don\u2019t want to go through a lengthy signup process. You might also want to avoid the ID verification process. In that case, you can use a Bitcoin ATM to get physical cash. This option provides a hassle-free method of converting your Bitcoin into local currency.\n\nA Bitcoin ATM is a physical center where you can purchase Bitcoin using fiat money. In addition, you can also sell your Bitcoins to get local currency. Currently, you can find Bitcoin ATMs in over 76 countries. Thus, getting a Bitcoin ATM is becoming easier in most countries.\n\nBear in mind that not every Bitcoin ATM allows you to sell your Bitcoin for a local currency. Also, each ATM has different sell and buy limits, supported coins, and fees. Nevertheless, using a Bitcoin ATM is an ideal method for small Bitcoin transactions. That\u2019s because the withdrawal limits for most ATMs range from $1,000 to $10,000. Also, Bitcoin ATMs have high transaction fees compared to crypto exchanges.\n\nUse Bitcoin debit card\n\nA Bitcoin debit card might not turn Bitcoins into cash. However, it provides a way to spend your Bitcoins. It works like a regular debit card. People load Bitcoins into this debit card and convert them into fiat money like the USD, GBP, AUD, and EUR.\n\nWith a Bitcoin debit card, a person can pay for services and products online and offline. What\u2019s more, you can withdraw cash at any ATM that accepts Master/VISA cards. Therefore, anybody that uses Bitcoin should have a Bitcoin debit card because it enables them to pay for products and services offline and online anywhere globally.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nYou have many ways to convert Bitcoins into fiat money. However, consider your profits before you do that. That\u2019s because your reason for buying this virtual currency might have been to make profits. Also, you will pay tax for your profits when converting Bitcoins to cash."}, {"headline": "FxWirePro:GBP/AUD attracts selling interest, vulnerable to more downside", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "EconoTimes", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/uploads/20210702609e438de5f191a78_th_1024x0.jpg", "author": [], "body": "\u2022GBP/AUD declined on Friday as dovish steer from Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has sent sterling sharply lower versus Australian dollar.\n\n\u2022 The is pair heading towards the 50%fib, as near term direction of the pair is likely to be driven by current price action.\n\n\u2022Technical signals are bearish as RSI is heading down , daily momentum studies 5, 9 and 10DMAs are trending down.\n\n\u2022Immediate resistance is located at 1.8446 (38.2%fib ), any close above will push the pair towards 1.8449(Higher BB).\n\n\u2022Strong support is seen at 1.8369 (50%fib) and break below could take the pair towards 1.8335 (30DMA).\n\nRecommendation: Good to sell on around 1.8400, with stop loss of 1.8480and target price of 1.9320\n\n"}, {"headline": "Australian Dollar Risk Could Lift GBP/AUD Further Westpac Says", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "Pound Sterling LIVE", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://www.poundsterlinglive.com/images/stock/sydney-australian-dollar-1.jpg", "author": ["Gary Howes"], "body": "- Aussie virus troubles, RBA uncertainty supports GBP/AUD\n\n- May see AUD/USD slip to 0.74 ahead of July RBA decision\n\n- RBA QE policy, rate stance key to outlook through summer\n\nGBP/AUD reference rates at publication:\n\nSpot: 1.8383\n\nBank transfer rates (indicative guide): 1.7740-1.7868\n\nMoney transfer specialist rates (indicative): 1.8220-1.8254\n\nMore information on securing specialist rates, here\n\nSet up an exchange rate alert, here\n\nThe Pound-to-Australian Dollar exchange rate is one of few Sterling pairs to have remained on its front foot in the last month, although analysts at Westpac say it could rise further over the short-term due to mounting downside risks to the Aussie that could crystalise following the July 07 Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) policy decision.\n\nLarge Australian metropolitan hubs including Sydney and its surrounding areas were thrown back into \u2018lockdown\u2019 in the final week of the second quarter after one of the coronavirus\u2019 many new derivatives made it across the country\u2019s closed international borders and into its economic nerve centres.\n\nThose nerve centres already accounted for more than a fifth of Australian economic output although since then other areas including Darwin and the country\u2019s third largest economic state Queensland have edged closer toward renewed shutdown also, which has been weighing on the Aussie with mere days to go before the all-important RBA decision.\n\nThe RBA will announce next week what it intends to do about a A$100bn or A$5bn per week quantitative easing programme that is set to reach the end of its lifespan in September, and will also have an opportunity to respond to recent market speculation about Aussie interest rates.\n\n\u201cSydney's lockdown has at least 8 days to run while activity restrictions around Australia change by the day. We are warned that this will remain the unsettling situation until vaccination rates are much higher,\u201d says Sean Callow, a strategist at Westpac.\n\nCallow wrote in a research note Thursday that a restive U.S. Dollar and risks posed to Australia\u2019s economic recovery by its government\u2019s handling of the pandemic could see AUD/USD slipping to 0.74 in the short-term, which is a price move that would be highly supportive of GBP/AUD.\n\nAbove: Pound-Australian Dollar rate shown at daily intervals alongside AUD/USD.\n\nAchieve up to 3-5% more currency for your money transfers. Beat your bank's rate by using a specialist FX provider: find out how.\n\n\u201cAustralia\u2019s very strong trade position and leverage to Asian growth should help AUD/GBP back to 0.56 , but near term, only a hawkish RBA surprise seems likely to prevent sustained trade below 0.5400,\u201d Callow says, before warning; \u201cThere is discussion of whether Australia\u2019s current Covid clusters, notably in Sydney, could cause the RBA Board to lean to the dovish side, albeit just in rhetoric rather than policy settings.\u201d\n\nCallow has warned that without a possibly-unlikely lift from the RBA the Australian Dollar is in danger of ceding more ground to Sterling in the short-term and enough for the Pound-Aussie rate to potentially be on the cusp of a break above last week\u2019s one-year high around 1.85.\n\nThe Pound-Aussie rate would trade as high as 1.8640 if AUD/USD reached 0.74 and at the same time GBP/USD held onto the nearby 1.38 handle, though gains would be less if U.S. Dollar strength leads GBP/USD to decisively give up the 1.38 level.\n\nNext week\u2019s decision will also afford the RBA its first formal opportunity to comment on the recent evolution of market expectations for its record low 0.10% cash rate, which have seen investors betting increasingly over the last month or so that the benchmark could be lifted by late 2022.\n\nThe RBA has so-far said its cash rate will not rise from that level \u201cat least until 2024\u201d and now that renewed renewed restrictions on business and social contact are threatening to deal a fresh setback to a job market that had just seen unemployment return to its pre-pandemic low, the bank might now feel compelled to reiterate and assure of its ongoing support for the economy.\n\n\u201cAUD/USD faces two downside risks in the next few days if a solid US non\u2011farm payrolls report tomorrow can lead to an upward revision to US interest rate expectations in favour of broad USD strength and the RBA maintains its ultra\u2011dovish stance at next Tuesday\u2019s meeting,\u201d says Elias Haddad, a strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.\n\nAbove: Westpac graph showing market expectations for percentage point changes in major central bank interest rates.\n\nIf the RBA reiterates next Tuesday its now-longstanding position that borrowing costs and interest returns to creditors are unlikely to go anywhere for years yet the bank would all but rule out the 2022 interest rate rise that pricing in overnight-index-swap markets implies investors are banking, and this could have downside implications for an Australian Dollar that was already the fourth worst performing \u2018G10\u2019 currency of the year so far.\n\nAustralian Dollar declines that weigh on AUD/USD would be supportive of GBP/AUD as the latter always closely reflects the relative performance of the former and the main Sterling exchange rate GBP/USD, which doesn\u2019t face the same central bank burden that the Aussie does.\n\n\u201cWe continue to doubt that sterling's rally will get back on track, and expect GBP/USD to ease to around $1.35 by the end of this year,\u201d says Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, in a recent note. \u201cIn order for sterling to rise further this year, it must become the conventional wisdom that the MPC will hike sooner and/or further than the U.S. Fed. Such a development seems highly unlikely.\u201d\n\nThe Pound has itself underperformed many other currencies since late last month when the Bank of England (BoE) noted in minutes of June\u2019s meeting that it would be important to avoid the kind of \u201cunwarranted tightening of financial conditions\u201d that could arise from misplaced speculation about any prospect of an interest rate rise any time soon, even after observing a better-than-expected performance from the UK economy in recent months.\n\nAbove: Pound-to-Australian Dollar rate shown at weekly intervals alongside GBP/USD.\n\nThe Pound-to-Australian Dollar rate has edged higher nonetheless, and for obvious reasons too given that despite the BoE ruling out interest rate rises any time, the UK\u2019s central bank is still tiptoeing its way toward ending its crisis-inspired quantitative easing programme later this year.\n\n\u201cThe BoE and RBA both have their key rates at 0.1% but markets price about a 50% chance of the BoE hiking by Aug 2022, keeping the 2 year spread in sterling\u2019s favour,\u201d Westpac\u2019s Callow says.\n\nAustralia\u2019s central bank is, on the other hand, widely expected to announce a value top up and duration extension of its own government bond buying programme next week and some influential economists have suggested that it may not actually get as far as even beginning to reduce its weekly purchase rate until year-end or after which makes for a clear divergence between the RBA and BoE.\n\n\u201cWe think the Board will be committed to maintaining the current pace of purchase ($5 billion per week) until late in the year (around the December Board meeting),\u201d writes Bill Evans, Westpac\u2019s chief economist, in a note this week.\n\n\u201cWhile there will be no clear assurances next Tuesday, we expect that the RBA will be aiming at timing its tapering of the program for the new year \u2013 we expect the FED to announce its taper in September with a view to beginning the taper in January. We expect both central banks will have completed their purchase programs by mid-year,\u201d Evans says."}, {"headline": "Foreign transfers with OFX compared", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Best Exchange Rates", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/bestexchangerates.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ofx-header-e1594602502687.jpg?fit=967%2C396&ssl=1", "author": ["Carlos Canada", "Stephen Frost", "Expat Bob", "Rene Fr"], "body": "OFX is one of the world\u2019s largest and best providers of international money transfers.

You\u2019d pay roughly 1 percent for the same amount to be sent to Europe but 2 percent if sending to India. This compares with 4\u20137 percent with the banks.\n\nFor other currency routes we looked at (routes involving AUD, INR, GBP, EUR, SGD and USD), the average cost of an international payment with OFX was 0.6 percent of the transferred amount. This is exceptional if compared with banks but is perhaps double what is charged by the industry\u2019s lowest-cost services, although such services might not offer the same benefits as OFX.\n\nIMPORTANT: For BestExchangeRates readers, OFX will waive its flat A$15 transfer fee permanently, so be sure to sign up via one of our links.\n\nBe aware that transferred funds might be subject to a third-party bank receiving fee. Such fees are entirely out of OFX\u2019s control and OFX receives no part of them. You can phone OFX\u2019s support line to seek further information on third-party fees.\n\nOFX Foreign Transfer Rates & Fees - Compared\n\nLoading rates... Provider Amounts Rate Cost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Long Will My Transfer Take?\n\nAfter OFX receives your funds, these will usually arrive at the destination bank account within 2 business days. 80 percent of OFX transfers are received within 1 business day.\n\nMinimum / Maximum Transfer Size\n\nOFX has low minimums. You can transfer any amount above AUD 250 or GBP 100 or local currency equivalent.\n\nThe maximum amount you can transfer depends on the currency being sent. Major currencies like USD, GBP, AUD, CAD, EUR and NZD can usually be transferred freely, and OFX can handle billions worth of these. However, controlled currencies like the Chinese yuan, South African rand and South Korean won might be subject to government restrictions.\n\nIs Money Safe with OFX?\n\nThe short answer is \u201cyes\u201d \u2014 as safe as it can be.\n\nOFX deploys top-notch security systems, is highly regulated and has an inherently low-risk business model, which means that it offers a deliverable-only FX service and does not take positions in the markets, thereby eliminating market risk.\n\nAs for your money, this is held separately from OFX\u2019s own funds in a major financial institution.\n\nAs part of its account-protecting technology, OFX deploys algorithms that monitor registrations, logins and transactions to identify suspicious activity, and other tech includes a multi-layered fraud prevention system that works against phishing, malware and apps that might target customer accounts.\n\nNeedless to say, SSL encryption is used to keep your information safe from prying digital eyes.\n\nOFX is regulated by more than 55 different financial authorities, including the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).\n\nAll said, we cannot see any reason why funds would be at risk with OFX.\n\nSupport for Online Retailers: Multi-Currency Accounts\n\nOFX has recently added support for online sellers on Amazon, eBay, Newegg, Buy.com, Shop.com and many other marketplaces. This support comes in the form of the OFX Global Currency Account, which provides local currency accounts for each of the following: USD, GBP, HKD, EUR, CAD and AUD.\n\nFunds from your marketplace or payment gateway can be paid straight into a Global Currency Account and suppliers can also be paid at the best possible exchange rates. With such an account, your online business can avoid a great deal of the unnecessary back-and-forth FX charges associated with cross-border trade. Visit OFX for Online Sellers.\n\nAdvanced Features: Forwards, Limit Orders, Bulk and Recurring Payments\n\nOFX provides a number of risk and FX management features that businesses will appreciate.\n\nForward contracts are an effective way of managing foreign currency exposures for those who stand to lose significant amounts if exchange rates move against them in the coming days or months (up to 12 months). A forward buyer can lock in an exchange rate today for a transfer that will be paid for in future. Once you\u2019ve signed up with OFX, give one of their reps a call to discuss your unique hedging requirements.\n\nBulk payments, such as those needed for payrolls, are easily done using Multipay, which allows for 500 payments to be sent at once.\n\nLimit orders allow users to convert money at exchange rates better than today\u2019s. Once a desired rate has been specified, OFX systems will monitor the FX market on a user\u2019s behalf, triggering money transfers once the market rate matches the desired rate. A downside of this feature is that it comes with a minimum transaction size of AUD 30,000 or GBP 20,000 (varies by currency).\n\nRecurring transfers are available, such as those needed for overseas mortgages. With OFX, a payment plan can be set up at a fixed, agreed-upon exchange rate so you know exactly what you\u2019re spending each month.\n\nCustomer Service\n\nCustomer service at OFX is 24/7 and support options are excellent. These include 10 national phone lines reaching support staff in 7 countries, email support and an extensive FAQ section on the main site.\n\nThough there are disappointed customers to be found online, as there are with any service, the bulk of OFX customers (we estimate 80 percent) report highly professional support when things go wrong, with adjectives like \u201cthorough,\u201d \u201cunderstanding,\u201d \u201cprompt\u201d and \u201cknowledgeable\u201d used to describe OFX staff.\n\nOFX outlines a complaints policy on its site but be aware that a final response to complaints might take as long as 45 days, which is longer than we\u2019d like.\n\nWhat Do Users Think of OFX?\n\nAt the time of writing this review (June 2019), more than 3,000 of the 3,500 Trustpilot reviewers had rewarded OFX a 5-star rating, and that should speak volumes. As you\u2019d expect from any top firm in the payments industry, common themes within reviews relate to: \u201cgreat exchange rates,\u201d \u201cexcellent service,\u201d \u201cbetter than the banks,\u201d \u201cquick service\u201d and \u201ceasy to get hold of,\u201d among others.\n\n\n\nCustomers registering through BER will have all their fees waived.\n\nMore OFX Articles\n\nOFX Global Currency Account \u2013 BER Review OFX Global Currency Account \u2013 Independent BER Review OFX Global Currency Account: A Summary OFX has a 30-year history and is one of the largest foreign exchange specialists in the world.

While investor focus remains affixed to tonight\u2019s non-farm payroll data, a robust ISM manufacturing report helped bolster demand for the USD and drive an uptick across US 10-year treasury yields. Renewed demand for the USD this week has forced the AUD to mark new year-to-date lows, slipping off intraday highs at 0.7505 to touch 0.7461. Having fallen through the post FOMC low, the AUD is now vulnerable to a deeper near-term correction. A break below 0.74 could trigger a run toward supports at 0.7290/0.730 and 0.72 US cents. We still believe the AUD is undervalued at these levels when marked back to historical drivers and would expect the currency to recover as we move through Q3 and into Q4. However, there are significant headwinds now clouding this outlook. Sustained inflationary pressure, ongoing and escalating China trade tensions and the impacts caused by the Delta variant could extend the current bearish outlook and force a correction in medium-term forecasts.\n\nKey Movers\n\nThe US dollar strengthened through trade on Thursday, as leading domestic indicators suggest today\u2019s non-farm payroll print will show strong growth across the labor market, as the US economy continues to reopen. The ISM manufacturing survey showed the manufacturing sector has maintained recent momentum, printing near record highs. While there remains intense pressure on input and component prices, signals that supply constraints are starting to ease helped fuel expectations inflation concerns could well be transitory. With jobless claims falling to a pandemic low, there is an expectation a faster than anticipated labour market recovery will force the Fed to bring forward its timeline of monetary policy adjustment. The Blomberg index advanced 0.3% and the USD now sits near the highs, enjoyed in the wake of the FOMC policy update in mid-June.\n\nThe euro was able to stave off a significant sell, off edging only marginally lower on the day, yet still marked new 3-month lows below 1.1850, while the yen slipped to its lowest level since March and the GBP failed to hold above 1.38. The pound came under pressure following comments from Bank of England Governor Bailey. Bailey reiterated statements issued after the last BoE policy meeting reminding investors it is crucial the Bank does not undermine the recovery by tightening monetary policy too quickly. The comments dampened expectations the UK and BoE could move ahead of schedule, as inflation pressures grow and the recovery outpaces expectations.

The broker must be an ideal match for your trading goals and approach. Not only your fund\u2019s security but also your success rate in trading depends on your broker to a great extent. So, it is crucial to carefully choose one among the many available in the forex market.\n\nTake a look at the best forex brokers of 2021 below.\n\nLeading UK Forex Brokers\n\nWhat is a Forex Broker?\n\nIn the foreign exchange market or vastly known as the forex market, the transactions primarily conduct between a pair of two independent currencies. In the course of buying and selling cryptocurrencies, a forex broker is typically a financial service company that acts as an intermediary between the trader and the interbank system. While making a transaction between a pair of currencies that are generally made of the ten most traded and liquid currencies including USD, EUR, AUD, and others, traders can initiate and execute a trade using a forex broker and earn profit depending on the current exchange rate.\n\nHow Do Forex Brokers Work?\n\nThe forex broker typically works as an intermediary between you and the interbank system, which is a network of banks that trade with each other daily. The broker will typically offer you a price from the banks and financial institutions through which they have access to forex liquidity.\n\nWhen you start trading with a forex broker and open your first trade, the broker will pass it through the market. They offer you a price for that particular forex pair, typically shown in quote form such as GBP/USD 1.3500/1.3505. Here, the first number is the rate the broker offers you if you want to sell the pair. The second number shows the rate at which you can buy the pair. The difference between the numbers i.e., .0005 or 5 pips is taken as a commission by the broker and is known as the spread.\n\nA broker will typically provide you with a trading platform, which is a software program that can either be downloaded or used via a browser on the web. This is the main platform where you buy and sell currencies, monitor trades, conduct technical analysis, and all related functions of trading. Once the broker executes your order, it can either be a winning or a losing trade, leading to a profit or loss for your trading account.\n\nBest UK Forex Brokers \u2013 Top 10 Reviewed\n\n1. eToro \u2013 Best of the Best Forex Brokers\n\nFounded in 2007, eToro is one of the leading forex brokers worldwide.

While making a transaction between a pair of currencies that are generally made of the ten most traded and liquid currencies including USD, EUR, AUD, and others, traders can initiate and execute a trade using a forex broker and earn profit depending on the current exchange rate.\n\nHow Do Forex Brokers Work?\n\nThe forex broker typically works as an intermediary between you and the interbank system, which is a network of banks that trade with each other daily. The broker will typically offer you a price from the banks and financial institutions through which they have access to forex liquidity.\n\nWhen you start trading with a forex broker and open your first trade, the broker will pass it through the market. They offer you a price for that particular forex pair, typically shown in quote form such as GBP/USD 1.3500/1.3505. Here, the first number is the rate the broker offers you if you want to sell the pair. The second number shows the rate at which you can buy the pair. The difference between the numbers i.e., .0005 or 5 pips is taken as a commission by the broker and is known as the spread.\n\nA broker will typically provide you with a trading platform, which is a software program that can either be downloaded or used via a browser on the web. This is the main platform where you buy and sell currencies, monitor trades, conduct technical analysis, and all related functions of trading. Once the broker executes your order, it can either be a winning or a losing trade, leading to a profit or loss for your trading account.\n\nKnowing Which UK Forex Brokers Are The Best\n\n\n\nWith a myriad of choices available when it comes to forex brokers, you can easily get confused and end up making a bad choice.

The broker should be regulated by a major international regulatory body.\n\nDo\u2019s and Don\u2019t\u2019s\n\nPicking the right forex broker will certainly nudge you in the right direction. However, success in the forex market also depends on your actions. You should thus know what to do and what not to do to minimise losses and maximise profits.\n\nDo:\n\nDevelop a concrete plan: You should always try to develop a concrete plan before you dive into the market. Evaluate your goals and objectives before you cast your first trade. Entering the market without a plan can have disastrous consequences, especially if one trades impulsively.\n\nAlways use stop loss and take profit: It\u2019s always important to sit down and evaluate the amount of profit that you feel is realistically achievable. This extends to the use of stop-loss and take-profit levels. Failure to choose fixed levels for closing your trading position will result in closing trades based on emotion.\n\nResearching the market: Staying on top of the factors that affect the forex market. This can extend to international politics, news regarding financial regulations, and other factors such as wars and natural disasters. Typically you would want to get real-time information on factors that affect the currency pair you\u2019re trading, such as the country\u2019s inflation rates and other economic markers.\n\nDon\u2019t:\n\nDon\u2019t commit money you can\u2019t afford to lose: There is a fine line between trading cautiously and outright gambling. So you should always stay within the budget parameters set. It is very easy to get carried away and end up investing more money than you originally planned in forex trading.\n\nDon\u2019t commit revenge trading: Revenge trading is when you try to make up for losses incurred earlier in the day by impulsively executing trades. Do not fall for this trap as you will end up trading using raw emotion rather than trading rules, leading to more losses. You should rather use take-profit levels to lock your gains once you reach your profit target levels. This will alleviate the temptation for further gains.\n\nDon\u2019t let emotions take over: Human emotions such as greed and fear can lead to impractical trading decisions where you will end up incurring a loss. For instance, fear can lead to traders closing their positions early missing out on profits. Always remember that you should stick to your set plan and exit the market once your target profit level for the day has been achieved.\n\nHow to Begin Trading With Forex Brokers \u2013 eToro Guide\n\n\n\nOnce you have made up your mind about which forex broker to use for trading your preferred forex pairs then all that is left to do is start trading.
