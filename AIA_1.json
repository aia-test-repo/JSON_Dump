Dollar Gains but US Yields, Rate Hike Odds Fall - Market Minutes", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "DailyFX", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://a.c-dn.net/b/4jyRfL/headline_dollar2.jpg", "author": ["Christopher Vecchio", "Senior Strategist", "Recommended"], "body": "Advertisement\n\nMarket Minutes Overview:\n\nThe US Dollar (via the DXY Index) is at levels that would constitute its high close for July, just days after the \u2018goldilocks\u2019 June US nonfarm payrolls report.\n\nFalling US Treasury yields and US rate hike expectations draw into question the legitimacy of US Dollar strength.\n\nComing out of the US holiday weekend, and with European football semi-finals this week, various measures of volatility continue to decline.\n\nA Mixed Bag\n\nThe US yield curve is flattening. US equity markets are dipping. Some agricultural commodities are limit down. And with the US Dollar (via the DXY Index) at levels that would constitute its high close for the month despite USD/JPY rates falling back, it appears that markets are in a \u2018risk-off\u2019 mood following the \u2018goldilocks\u2019 June US nonfarm payrolls report and US holiday weekend.\n\nThere may be a good reason to suggest that it\u2019s the risk-off nature of markets pushing the US Dollar higher rather than some domestic-oriented factor: rate hike odds aren\u2019t following.\n\nWe can measure whether a rate hike is being priced-in using Eurodollar contracts by examining the difference in borrowing costs for commercial banks over a specific time horizon in the future. Chart 1 below showcases the difference in borrowing costs \u2013 the spread \u2013 for the July 2021 and December 2023 contracts, in order to gauge where interest rates are headed in the interim period between July 2021 and December 2023.\n\nEurodollar Futures Contract Spread (July 2021-December 2023): Daily Rate Chart (March to July 6, 2021) (Chart 1)\n\nAt their high last week after the June US nonfarm payrolls report, there were 107-bps worth of rate hikes discounted by December 2023; now, there are 92-bps priced-in. Markets are taking a less hawkish view of the FOMC; typically, this has corresponded with US Dollar weakness.\n\nVideo Technical Notes: DXY Index\n\nThe DXY Index is rebounding from familiar territory around the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the 2018 low/2020 high range and the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the 2011 low/2020 high range near 91.90. As a result, a bullish daily outside engulfing bar is forming.\n\nB ullish momentum is firming. The daily 5-EMA continues to serve as support with the entire daily EMA envelope aligned in bullish sequential order. Daily MACD is rising while in bullish territory, while daily Slow Stochastics are holding in overbought territory . It remains the case that a run towards triangle resistance near 92.75 may be in the car d s soon.\n\nAn Interesting Calendar\n\nComing out of the holiday week, and with European football semi-finals this week (today and tomorrow), various measures of volatility continue to decline. In this context, the economic calendar appears like an oasis this week: in what should be an otherwise quiet environment, data releases offer succor in the form of event risk volatility.\n\nThe June FOMC meeting minutes are first on the radar, followed by Chinese and Mexican inflation readings on Thursday that could ignite a spark in the commodity currency complex (AUD, CAD, NZD).\n\nDailyFX Economic Calendar, \u2018High\u2019 Rate Events, Next 48-hours (Table 1)\n\n--- Written by Christopher Vecchio, CFA, Senior Currency Strategist"}, {"headline": "All eyes on the RBA press conference; will it spark an AUD recovery?", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "FXStreet", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://editorial.fxstreet.com/images/Markets/Currencies/Majors/AUDUSD/hundred-bucks-3645622_Large.jpg", "author": [], "body": "AUD - Australian Dollar\n\nThe Australian dollar maintained a narrow handle through Monday in what was a relatively quiet start to the trading week. With most US investors enjoying 4th of July holiday celebrations price action was muted as liquidity and volume were thin. The AUD bounced between 0.7510 and 0.7540 for much of the day unable to extend upward momentum and recoup losses suffered mid-June. Despite improving risk appetite and elevated commodity prices Investors appear reluctant in extending risk appetite gains. Uncertainty surrounding the Delta variant and global economic recovery have overcome the long run reflation narrative and continue to weigh on the AUD through the near-term. Our attentions today turn to the RBA policy update. Today\u2019s meeting has been billed as a tipping point, wherein policy makers will announce an amendment to the current stance on QE and monetary policy. Market consensus suggest the board will begin tapering bond purchase while maintaining the April 2024 yield curve target. A surprise announcement could spark price action and an interesting market response. A dovish narrative could sink the AUD and see the currency test lows below 0.7450.\n\nKey Movers\n\nFourth of July celebrations meant liquidity across major currencies remained thin through trade on Monday, prompting little price action and narrow ranges. The Euro, GBP, CAD and JPY all tracked sideways reluctant to extend moves outside a 0.2% plus/minus. The Euro did test a break back toward 1.19, touching intraday day highs at 1.1880 after service PMI data surpassed expectations. However, a dip in investor confidence saw the combined unit slip back toward 1.1850 before edging slightly higher into this morning\u2019s open. Our attentions turn now to the US ISM service PMI index. Having touched near record highs in May there is an expectation the index will correct lower in June, however as the US economic recovery gather pace a surprise to the upside is not out of the question. We are keenly attuned to the underlying indicators held within the dataset, particularly input costs. With inflation pressures growing a sustained uptick in through costs driven by supply constraints will likely mean transitory price pressures will remain in play through the near term.\n\nExpected Ranges\n\nAUD/USD: 0.7450 - 0.7630 \u25b2\n\n\n\nAUD/EUR: 0.6290 - 0.6410 \u25b2\n\n\n\nGBP/AUD: 1.8290 - 1.8550 \u25bc\n\n\n\nAUD/NZD: 1.0650 - 1.0770 \u25b2\n\n\n\nAUD/CAD: 0.9230 - 0.9350 \u25b2"}, {"headline": "Euro Shrugs Strong Investor Confidence, Markets in Subdued Holiday Trading", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Action Forex", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://www.actionforex.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/f-eur132.jpg", "author": [], "body": "Overall, the forex markets are relatively mixed today and trading will probably continue to be subdued with US on holiday. Sterling is currently the stronger one, followed by Yen and Aussie. Canadian is the weakest, followed by Kiwi and then Swiss. Eurozone is mixed despite strong investor sentiment data. But all major pairs and crosses are staying inside Friday\u2019s range. Some volatility could finally be seen again, especially in Aussie, with RBA rate decision scheduled in the upcoming Asian session.\n\nTechnically, it looks like AUD/CAD has defended 0.9247 key support again. Further rebound tomorrow, subject to RBA\u2019s decision and statement, could pop the cross back towards 0.9394 resistance. Firm break there will complete a double bottoming pattern (0.9258, 0.9245), and turn near term outlook bullish. We\u2019ll see if that would happen.\n\nIn Europe, at the time of writing, FTSE is up 0.52%. DAX is up 0.05%. CAC is up 0.35%. Germany 10-year yield is up 0.0232 at -0.211. Earlier in Asia, Nikkei dropped -0.64%. Hong Kong HSI dropped -0.59%. China Shanghai SSE rose 0.44%. Singapore Strait Times rose 0.39%. Japan 10-year JGB yield dropped -0.0104 to 0.036.\n\nEurozone Sentix investor confidence rose to 29.8, but expectations dropped\n\nEurozone Sentix Investor Confidence rose to 29.8 in July, up from 28.1, but missed expectation of 30.2. Nonetheless, it\u2019s still the 5th increase in a row, and highest since February 2018. Current situation index rose from 21.3 to 29.8, 5th increase in a row, and highest since October 2018. Expectations index, however, dropped from 35.3 to 29.8, lowest since December 2020.\n\nSentix said, \u201cthe result is impressive\u201d but, \u201cwe are approaching a certain point of maximum momentum in the short term\u201d as expectations dropped. \u201cFor the economy as a whole, this is not yet a worrying decline. For the equity markets, on the other hand, which are very much focused on investor expectations, this development could contribute to increased market volatility.\u201d\n\nIt added, \u201cin this environment, the ECB remains in focus. So far, there is no sign of a turn away from the expansive monetary policy. However, the inflation barometer, which remains clearly in negative territory at -38.25, underscores the danger of further rising inflation rates in a globally increasingly synchronised, strong economic upswing.\u201d\n\nEurozone PMI composite reached 16-yr high, recovery stepped up a gear, but inflationary pressures ratcheted higher\n\nEurozone PMI Services was finalized at 58.3 in June, up from May\u2019s 55.2. PMI Composite was finalized at 59.5, up from May\u2019s 57.1. That\u2019s also the highest level in 15 years since June 2006. Looking at some member states, Ireland PMI composite dipped to 2 month low at 63.4. Spain hit 256-month high at 62.4. Germany hit 123-month high at 60.1. Italy reached 41-month high at 58.3. France also reached 41-month high at 57.4.\n\nChris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit said: \u201cEurope\u2019s economic recovery stepped up a gear in June, but inflationary pressures have also ratcheted higher\u2026 A wave of optimism that the worst of the pandemic is behind us has meanwhile propelled firms\u2019 expectations of growth to the highest for 21 years, boding well for the upturn to gain further strength in coming months.\n\n\u201cFirms are increasingly struggling to meet surging demand, however, in part due to labour supply shortages, meaning greater pricing power and underscoring how the recent rise in inflationary pressures is by no means confined to the manufacturing sector. Service sector companies are hiking their prices at the steepest pace for over 20 years as costs spike higher, accompanying a similar jump in manufacturing prices to signal a broad-based increase in inflationary pressures.\u201d\n\nUK PMI services finalized at 62.4, composite at 62.2\n\nUK PMI Services was finalized at 62.4 in June, down slightly from May\u2019s 62.9. That\u2019s still the second-highest reading since October 2013. PMI Composite dropped to 62.2, down from 62.9. That\u2019s also the second-highest reading since January 1998.\n\nTim Moore, Economics Director at IHS Markit: \u201cThe service sector recovery remained in full swing during June as looser pandemic restrictions released pent up demand for business and consumer services. Sales growth eased slightly from May\u2019s recent peak, but capacity constraints and staff shortages meant that many service providers struggled to keep up with new orders\u2026\n\n\u201cThe latest survey data highlighted survey-record rates of input cost and prices charged inflation across the service sector, reflecting higher commodity prices, transport shortages and staff wages. Imbalanced supply and demand was the main driver, while the roll-back of pandemic discounting by some service providers amplified the latest round of price hikes.\u201d\n\nBoJ upgraded economic assessment of 2 regions, downgraded 2, kept 5 unchanged\n\nIn the Regional Economic Report, BoJ upgraded economic assessment of 2 regions (Hokuriku and Kinki), downgraded 2 regions (Chugoku and Shikoku), and kept 5 regions unchanged (Hokkaido, Tohoku, Kanto-Koshinetse, Tokaiand Kyshu-Okinawa).\n\nIt added: \u201cwhile they reported that their economy had remained in a severe situation due to the impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) \u2014 with some reporting that it had seen a slowdown in the pace of its pick-up \u2014 many reported that it had picked up as a trend or had started to pick up.\u201d\n\nGovernor Haruhiko Kuroda told branch managers, \u201cJapan\u2019s economy remains in a severe state but is picking up as a trend\u2026 As the pandemic\u2019s impact gradually eases, the economy will recover thanks to increasing external demand, loose monetary policy and the effect of government stimulus measures.\u201d\n\nAustralia retail sales rose 0.4% mom in May, impacted by Victorian lockdown\n\nAustralia retail sales rose 0.4% mom, 7.7% yoy in May. That\u2019s an upward revision to preliminary result of 0.1% mom rise.\n\nBen James, Director of Quarterly Economy Wide Surveys, said: \u201cThe main themes from the Retail Trade Preliminary release remain relevant for the Final release. Retail turnover in May was impacted by the Victorian lockdown from May 28 onwards, as well as those states recovering from restrictions in April.\u201d\n\nAustralia AiG construction dropped to 55.5, facing capacity constraints\n\nAustralia AiG Performance of Construction dropped -2.8 pts to 55.5 in June. Current activity dropped -0.9 to 54.8. Employment dropped -6.1 to 58.3. New orders rose 0.9 to 56.1. Supplier deliveries dropped -8.5 to 50.9. Input prices rose 2.5 to 98.3. Selling prices rose 7.0 to 85.2. Average wages rose 5.4 to 70.4.\n\nAi Group Head of Policy, Peter Burn, said: \u201cAustralia\u2019s construction industry continued its run of strong growth in June but the pace of expansion is slipping as it faces capacity constraints and rising input prices.\u201d\n\nAlso released, building permits dropped -7.1% mom in May, versus expectation of -5.0% mom.\n\nChina Caixin PMI services dropped to 50.3, PMI composite dropped to 50.6\n\nChina Caixin PMI Services dropped to 50.3 in June, down from 55.1, well below expectation of 55.7. There were the softest increase in activity and new work for 14-months. Staff numbers fell as capacity pressured eased. Rates of input cost and output charge inflation slowed notably. PMI Composite dropped to 50.6, down from 53.8, worst in 14-month.\n\nWang Zhe, Senior Economist at Caixin Insight Group said: \u201cOverall, activity in both the manufacturing and services sector continued to expand. However, impacted by the resurgence of the virus in some regions in China, the services sector was weaker than the manufacturing sector, both in terms of market supply and demand or employment.\u201d\n\nEUR/USD Mid-Day Outlook\n\nDaily Pivots: (S1) 1.1823; (P) 1.1849; (R1) 1.1890; More\u2026\n\nOutlook in EUR/USD remains unchanged and intraday bias stays neutral first. Further fall is expected as long as 1.1974 resistance holds. Break of 1.1806 will resume the decline from 1.2265, as the third leg of the consolidation pattern from 1.2348, to 1.1703 support. On the upside, break of 1.1973 resistance will turn bias back to the upside for 1.2265 resistance.\n\nIn the bigger picture, rise from 1.0635 is seen as the third leg of the pattern from 1.0339 (2017 low). Further rally could be seen to cluster resistance at 1.2555 next, (38.2% retracement of 1.6039 to 1.0339 at 1.2516). This will remain the favored case as long as 1.1602 support holds. Reaction from 1.2555 should reveal underlying long term momentum in the pair. However sustained break of 1.1602 will argue that the rise from 1.0635 is over, and turn medium term outlook bearish again.\n\nEconomic Indicators Update"}, {"headline": "Midday round up: The focus moves to AUD/CAD [Video]", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "FXStreet", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://editorial.fxstreet.com/images/Markets/Currencies/Crosses/AUDCAD/forex-australia-and-canadian-currency-pair-with-calculator-4456331_Large.jpg", "author": [], "body": "Note: All information on this page is subject to change.

Unemployment rose to 5.9% from 5.8% but markets were seemingly happy to look beyond that as a blip.\n\nUS equities went into overdrive mode with the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 accelerating higher at their record high. After seven consecutive days of gains it is now the best run for the S&P 500 since 1997.\n\nThe ASX 200 is trading in a potential triangle formation on the daily chart. We said the same thing last week, only for price action to evolve, invalidate the pattern and begin forming a new one. Something that should be factored in here is the time of year, so this may well just be a seasonal thing as opposed to a build-up to a convincing break. The fact we have a bullish and bearish pinbar on consecutive days last week underscores its lack of direction, so perhaps trading intraday ranges may be the best play until we see a convincing breakout, one way or another.\n\n\n\n\n\nASX 200 Market Internals:\n\n\n\n\n\nASX 200: 7308.6 (0.59%), 02 July 2021\n\nConsumer Discretionary (1.3%) was the strongest sector and Information Technology (-0.11%) was the weakest\n\n9 out of the 11 sectors closed higher\n\n3 out of the 11 sectors outperformed the index\n\n128 (64.00%) stocks advanced, 61 (30.50%) stocks declined\n\n72.5% of stocks closed above their 200-day average\n\n66% of stocks closed above their 50-day average\n\n52.5% of stocks closed above their 20-day average\n\nOutperformers:\n\n+ 20.3% - IDP Education Ltd (IEL.AX)\n\n+ 5.16% - A2 Milk Company Ltd (A2M.AX)\n\n+ 5.00% - Nickel Mines Ltd (NIC.AX)\n\nUnderperformers:\n\n-5.28% - IPH Ltd (IPH.AX)\n\n-4.37% - Megaport Ltd (MP1.AX)\n\n-2.99% - Netwealth Group Ltd (NWL.AX)\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the Weekly COT Report (Commitment of Traders)\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Tuesday 29th July 2021:\n\nNet-short exposure to the US dollar was reduced by -6.6 billion dollars accord to calculations from IMM, meaning 11.1 billion of short exposure has been reduced over the past two weeks.\n\nTraders are their most bearish on Japanese yen futures since May 2019, with net-short exposure being increased by 16k contracts. Gross shorts were increased by 9.3k contracts and gross shorts reduced by 6.7k contracts.\n\nElsewhere, weekly volume changes were quite across FX majors.\n\nTraders were bearish on AUD futures for a sixth consecutive week.\n\nGold futures traders had their lowest net-long exposure in two years.\n\nCopper saw its first increase in net-long exposure in 8-weeks. Whilst by a relatively small amount, its 1-year Z-score is at -2.1 standard deviations, so perhaps there is a case to build for a trough to form on copper prices.\n\nPlatinum also saw a slight increase in net-long exposure, although 25k short contracts were cut \u2013 its largest weekly decline since November 2019.\n\nLong/short positioning (75% and above):\n\nCAD futures: 75.2%\n\nS&P 500 futures: 84.5%\n\nWTI futures: 82.4%\n\n\n\n\n\nForex: 50-week eMA continues to cap dollar gains\n\nThe US dollar index (DXY) closed back beneath its 50-week eMA after a false break above it on Thursday. The daily chart closed with a three-bar reversal pattern (Evening star reversal) thanks to a broad sell-off of the dollar after NFP. The trend remains bullish above 91.51 on the daily chart but it now appears likely to be within a corrective phase.\n\nUSD/JPY formed a long-legged Doji on the weekly chart and a bearish outside day on Friday. With traders increasingly net-short on JY futures we suspect new highs will be on the card once its corrective phase has been completed, but the March 2020 (pandemic) peak has proved a tough level to crack upon its first attempt.\n\nEUR/USD closed back above the June low after a false break, leaving a bullish hammer on the daily chart and suggesting a minor bounce could now be on the cards.\n\nOf all the reversal pattens across FX majors, commodity FX were the most impressive. USD/CAD was the biggest move, falling 0.95% whilst NZD/USD and AUD/USD rallied 0.89% and 0.75% respectively, and all had large outside days.\n\nAUD/USD closed above 0.7500, although take note of the monthly pivot at 7070 which makes a likely resistance level.\n\nAUD/CAD has held above the October 2020 low, so there\u2019s the potential for a corrective bounce form current levels as it has effectively been in a sideways range since early June.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhilst there are similarities between AUD and NZD charts, we\u2019d prefer NZD/USD for counter-trend longs over the near-term. AUD/NZD is drifting lower (which shows NZD is outperforming AUD) and NZD/USD has done a better job at standing up to dollar strength on recent weeks.\n\nNote the false break for NZD/USD of its April low in June, and prices held above that false break last week (unlike AUD). Therefore, our bias is bullish above Friday\u2019s low and would welcome any low-volatility dips within Friday\u2019s range as it may help increase potential reward to risk ratio for retest of the June 25th high. Still, it has to conquer the 200-day eMA so we could expect some notice around current levels, but the initial target is the weekly R1 pivot, just beneath 0.7100.\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn how to trade forex\n\n\n\n\n\nCommodities: Gold considers a break of 1800\n\nGold rallied for a third day and came close to testing 1800, closing the week with a (relatively small) bullish pinbar. With the dollar showing signs of a corrective phase, then perhaps we will see gold back above 1800. And there\u2019s also the fact that prices are holding above trendline support (projected from the May 2019 low) after a particularly bearish month in June \u2013 so a retracement could be expected from those factors alone. A break above 1800 is the next key level for bulls to break which opens-up a clear run for 1860.\n\nWTI trades around 75.25 ahead of today\u2019s OPEC+ meeting. Should they fail to increase production by any meaningful amount then it could be headed for the October 2018 high of 76.90.\n\n\n\n\n\nUp Next (Times in AEST)\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can view all the scheduled events for today using our economic calendar, and keep up to date with the latest market news and analysis here."}, {"headline": "Focus Might Turns to Euro Selling While Dollar Rally Capped by Strong Risk Appetite", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Action Forex", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://www.actionforex.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/f-eur9-e1600272705134.jpg", "author": [], "body": "Dollar ended as the strongest one last week but Friday\u2019s steel fall after solid non-farm payroll job reports suggests that it\u2019s rally is already losing steam. It\u2019s still a bit early to call a bearish reversal for the greenback. Yet, strong risk-on sentiments could cap Dollar\u2019s upside attempts ahead, and even trigger a deeper pull back.\n\nEuro ended as the second weakest, next to Aussie, but the late development in EUR/AUD suggests that the favor is not on Euro\u2019s side. More importantly, developments in some crosses like EUR/CHF and EUR/CAD indicates that market focuses might turn to selling in Euro in crosses ahead. On the other hand, the late rebound in Canadian Dollar opens up some upside prospects for the near term.\n\nNASDAQ closed at new record, heading to 15k handle\n\nNASDAQ\u2019s up trend continued last wee after some hesitation, and finished with a strong close at new record high of 14639.32. Near term outlook will remain bullish as long as 14439.90 supports. Next target is 61.8% projection of 10822.57 to 14175.11 from 13002.53 at 15074.39.\n\nThat would be an important level to overcome as it\u2019s firstly close to 15k handle. More importantly, a strong break of 15k could put weekly MACD back into a rising track. That would in turn argues that NASDAQ is back in medium term up side acceleration. Strong break of 15k would set the stage for even more powerful rise in this 2H of the year.\n\nDOW to catch to resume record run.\n\nDOW also made some notable progress even though it\u2019s still lagging behind S&P 500 and NASDAQ. Current development argues that consolidation pattern from 35091.56 has already completed at 33271.93, after brief breach of medium term channel support.\n\nDOW could take on 35091.56 record high this week, and break will confirm resumption of larger up trend from 18213.65. Next target would be 100% projection of 18213.65 to 2919935 from 26143.77 at 37129.47.\n\nDollar index failed to extend rally, but more upside still mildly in favor\n\nDollar\u2019s development was rather disappointing, as it reacted more to strong risk-on sentiments much more than the solid NFP report. It\u2019s still too early to call an end to the rise from 89.53 as long as 91.51 support holds. Further rally would still be seen to 93.43 resistance and possibly above.\n\nBut we\u2019d maintain that rise from 89.53 is seen as the third leg of the consolidation pattern from 89.20. Hence, we\u2019d expect strong resistance from 38.2% retracement of 102.99 to 89.20 at 94.46 at 94.46. to limit upside, at least to extend sideway trading. Break of 91.51 will suggest that such rise has completed prematurely, and bring retest of 89.20/53 support zone.\n\nEUR/CHF and EUR/CAD turn weaker, more downside ahead\n\nEuro turned notably weaker in some crosses last week. In particular, EUR/CHF\u2019s break of 1.0939 support argues that rebound from 1.0863 has completed at 1.0985 already. It\u2019s also kept below medium term channel resistance, and struggled to sustain above 55 day EMA. The development argues that choppy decline from 1.1149 is still in progress.\n\nDeeper fall is not in favor for the near term to retest 1.0863 support first. Break will resume the fall from 1.1149 to cluster support level at 1.0737, 61.8% retracement of 1.0505 to 1.1149 at 1.0751.\n\nEUR/CAD also dropped notably on Friday and deeper fall is now in favor this week to retest 1.4580 support. The failure to sustain above falling 55 day EMA keeps near term outlook bearish. Break of 1.14580 will confirm resumption of larger decline from 1.5978 and target 61.8% projection of 1.5783 to 1.4723 from 1.5191 at 1.4536. Firm break there could bring further downside acceleration to 1.4263 long term support next.\n\nCanadian Dollar has some upside prospect ahead\n\nOn the other hand, Canadian Dollar has the prospect of turning stronger, with help from persistently strong oil price, BoC tapering expectation. But that would be subject to the upcoming employment data this week. Anyway, AUD/CAD\u2019s breach of 0.9258 support argues that larger fall from 0.9991 is resuming. Focus is back on 0.9247 key cluster support level (38.2% retracement of 0.8058 to 0.9991 at 0.9253).\n\nSustained break of 0.9247/53 will bring some downside re-acceleration to 61.8% projection of 0.9757 to 0.9258 from 0.9394 at 0.9086. There is prospect of even deeper fall to 61.8% retracement of 0.8058 to 0.9991 at 0.8796. Strong rebound from current level, followed by break of 0.9394 resistance will suggest short term bottoming, and bring turn the fortune between Aussie and Loonie.\n\nAUD/USD Weekly Outlook\n\nAUD/USD edged lower to 0.7443 last week but quickly recovered again. Initial bias is turned neutral this week first. Another fall could still be seen, and break of 0.7443 will resume the whole corrective pattern from 0.8006. But we\u2019d expect strong support from 100% projection of 0.8006 to 0.7530 from 0.7890 at 0.7414 to bring rebound. On the upside, break of 0.7615 resistance will indicate short term bottoming, on bearish divergence condition in 4 hour MACD. Intraday bias will be turned back to the upside for 0.7890/8006 resistance zone.\n\nIn the bigger picture, rise from 0.5506 medium term bottom could either be the start of a long term up trend, or a corrective rise. Reactions to 0.8135 key resistance will reveal which case it is. Rejection by 0.8135 key resistance, followed by firm break of 0.7413 resistance turned support, will favors the latter case. Deeper decline would be seen to 38.2% retracement of 0.5506 to 0.8006 at 0.7051 first.\n\nIn the longer term picture, 0.5506 is a long term bottom, on bullish convergence condition in monthly MACD. Focus is now back on 0.8135 structural resistance. Decisive break there will raise the chance that rise from 0.5506 is an impulsive up trend. Next target should be 61.8% retracement at 0.8950 of 1.1079 to 0.5506 and above. Though, rejection by 0.8135 will keep the case of medium to long term sideway consolidation open."}, {"headline": "AUD/CAD May Be a Catch-Up Trade in Q3: Q3 Top Trading Opportunities", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "DailyFX", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://a.c-dn.net/b/0TRbKm/headline_Generic_1.jpg", "author": ["Justin Mcqueen"], "body": "Coming in to Q2 my trade of short AUD/CAD had been predicated on US exceptionalism and the growing divergence between the BoC and RBA. While the US exceptionalism narrative dissipated, the theme of diverging monetary policy continues to bear watching. The divergence emerged was after the BoC tapered QE, while also signalling a rate increase for H2 2022. In contrast RBA signalled no rate increase before 2024. In Q3 AUD/CAD may be a catch up trade with BoC tightening priced into the currency, while strong Aussie data (employment in particular) may see the RBA to bring forward rate hike expectations.\n\nMeanwhile my view is that USD will head higher from current levels. The consensus trade for arguably the past year has been to short the USD as evidenced by CFTC data showing the build-up in net short positions. However, the FOMC\u2019s hawkish pivot in which the dot plot projections now see two rate hikes in 2023 from zero, suggests that the central bank\u2019s reaction function has changed with FOMC less willing to allow the economy to run hot. Under these conditions, economic data will matter more and spur heightened volatility on data releases.\n\nOn the monetary policy front, the main dates to focus are the Jackson Hole Symposium (marks one year since the launch of AIT) and the September monetary policy meeting. Given the sizeable net short USD positioning, an unwind can provide fuel for a more prolonged rise as we head towards a Q3 taper signal. To add to this, an increase in \u201cdemise of the dollar\u201d reporting late in Q2 coincided with the greenback\u2019s low point, which could suggest that the pain trade would be for a more persistent rise in the USD.\n\nUSD Chart: Daily Time Frame"}, {"headline": "Asian Open: The US Dollar Sits Tall Ahead of Nonfarm Payrolls", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "City Index", "date": "6 days ago", "image": "https://www.cityindex.co.uk/~/media/research/global/news-analysis/featured-image/jobs-2.jpg", "author": ["Stonex Financial Ltd", "Matt Simpson"], "body": "Asian Futures:\n\nAustralia's ASX 200 futures flat (0%), the cash market is currently estimated to open at 7,265.60\n\nJapan's Nikkei 225 futures are up 120 points (0.42%), the cash market is currently estimated to open at 28,827.04\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng futures are up 18 points (0.06%), the cash market is currently estimated to open at 28,845.95\n\nUK and Europe:\n\nUK's FTSE 100 index rose 87.69 points (1.25%) to close at 7,125.16\n\nEurope's Euro STOXX 50 index rose 14.59 points (0.36%) to close at 4,078.89\n\nGermany's DAX index rose 72.77 points (0.47%) to close at 15,603.81\n\nFrance's CAC 40 index rose 45.99 points (0.71%) to close at 6,553.82\n\nThursday US Close:\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial rose 131.02 points (0.38%) to close at 34,633.53\n\nThe S&P 500 index rose 22.44 points (0.53%) to close at 4,319.94\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 index rose 5.252 points (0.04%) to close at 14,560.05\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn how to trade indices\n\n\n\n\n\nIndices: S&P hits record high for 6th straight day\n\nAnother day, another set of strong employment data and record highs for the US stock market.

That said, the employment component of the ISM manufacturing index contracted to 49.9 from 50.9. But, taken alongside strong ADP beating expectations earlier this week (even if softer than the prior read), it\u2019s not a bad set of data overall ahead of today\u2019s NFP report. But, as Matt Weller points out, some leading indicators point towards a weaker-than expected NFP today which could lead to another disappointment for the highly anticipated release (and take the wind out of sentiment just before the weekend).\n\nThe S&P 500 hit a record high for a sixth consecutive session and rose 0.5%, led by energy, utility and financial sectors.

Let\u2019s hope NFP excels to live up to bullish expectation, or else gains be quickly lost.\n\nUSD/JPY reached our first target in the European session and second target in the US and is now trading slightly lower around 111.50. Its next major resistance levels to conquer are the pandemic and highs at 111.71 and 112.22 (with 112.00 thrown in due to being a round number, of course). If today\u2019s NFP data comes in strong enough it could reach 112.0 quite easily and possibly even 12.22. But, if it disappoints once again, we\u2019d expect prices to close firmly beneath the March 2020 high of 111.70 this week and roll over. Therefore, the March 2020 high is a pivotal level around today\u2019s FP report in our view.\n\nThe British pound was the weakest currency BOE\u2019s governor Andrew Bailey after saying it was important to not overact (ie. raise rates) to rising inflation. GBP/USD broken beneath key support of 1.3784 to an 11-week low and EUR/GBP rose 0.43% to print a bearish outside candle. Incidentally, GBP/USD was the weakest pair and EUR/GBP was the strongest.\n\nAUD/USD fell to its lowest level this year before finding support at the December 1st low It very much remains in the hands of today\u2019s NFP report. AUD/CAD warrants a look as it has formed a bullish hammer at the June low (and just above its October low). Granted, its not the prettiest of trades but there is potential for a counter-trend bounce, particularly if Canada\u2019s PMI data, building permits and trade balance data disappoints at 1:30pm tonight.\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn how to trade forex\n\n\n\n\n\nCommodities: OPEC+ send oil prices higher\n\nGold prices rallied for a second day and rose around 0.3%, which is not bad given the strength of the US dollar. We had tipped out hat to gold\u2019s potential to rise yesterday although it didn\u2019t quite reach our lower target of 1785. Still, with real-rates (represented by TIPS) continuing to fall, perhaps there\u2019s till room for gold to rise from here.\n\nThe OPEC+ meeting sent oil prices higher after indicating they would increase production at a slower rate than expected.

The broker should be regulated by a major international regulatory body.\n\nDo\u2019s and Don\u2019t\u2019s\n\nPicking the right forex broker will certainly nudge you in the right direction. However, success in the forex market also depends on your actions. You should thus know what to do and what not to do to minimise losses and maximise profits.\n\nDo:\n\nDevelop a concrete plan: You should always try to develop a concrete plan before you dive into the market. Evaluate your goals and objectives before you cast your first trade. Entering the market without a plan can have disastrous consequences, especially if one trades impulsively.\n\nAlways use stop loss and take profit: It\u2019s always important to sit down and evaluate the amount of profit that you feel is realistically achievable. This extends to the use of stop-loss and take-profit levels. Failure to choose fixed levels for closing your trading position will result in closing trades based on emotion.\n\nResearching the market: Staying on top of the factors that affect the forex market. This can extend to international politics, news regarding financial regulations, and other factors such as wars and natural disasters. Typically you would want to get real-time information on factors that affect the currency pair you\u2019re trading, such as the country\u2019s inflation rates and other economic markers.\n\nDon\u2019t:\n\nDon\u2019t commit money you can\u2019t afford to lose: There is a fine line between trading cautiously and outright gambling. So you should always stay within the budget parameters set. It is very easy to get carried away and end up investing more money than you originally planned in forex trading.\n\nDon\u2019t commit revenge trading: Revenge trading is when you try to make up for losses incurred earlier in the day by impulsively executing trades. Do not fall for this trap as you will end up trading using raw emotion rather than trading rules, leading to more losses. You should rather use take-profit levels to lock your gains once you reach your profit target levels. This will alleviate the temptation for further gains.\n\nDon\u2019t let emotions take over: Human emotions such as greed and fear can lead to impractical trading decisions where you will end up incurring a loss. For instance, fear can lead to traders closing their positions early missing out on profits. Always remember that you should stick to your set plan and exit the market once your target profit level for the day has been achieved.\n\nHow to Begin Trading with the Best Forex Trading Platform UK \u2013 eToro\n\n\n\nOnce you have made up your mind about which forex broker to use for trading your preferred forex pairs then all that is left to do is start trading.

It is also a matter of consideration to evaluate whether your trading style, preferred tools, and a chosen platform go hand-in-hand with the broker you have to opt for.\n\nTrade Now With Our Best UK Broker \u2013 eToro\n\nFAQs:"}, {"headline": "Exchange rates predict exchange rates: GBP/USD, USD/CAD, EUR/JPY", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "FXStreet", "date": "1 week ago", "image": "https://editorial.fxstreet.com/images/Markets/Currencies/Majors/GBPUSD/iStock-1088749732_Large.jpg", "author": [], "body": "GBP/USD Vs USD/CAD contained nearly a 2000 pip spread and nonnormal.

GBP/CHF minus USD/CAD reveals a massive EUR/JPY bottom at 125.00's.\n\nThe question to the 3 way Triangulation trades was GBP/USD at its top, USD/CAD at bottoms, or EUR/JPY at its top. The answer reveals 3 trades and each trades for 200 pips each.\n\nMany ways by exchange rates factor to exchange rates will lead to GBP/CAD, EUR/CAD, AUD/CAD, and NZD/CAD due to GBP/CAD and EUR/CAD as middle currency pairs to the EUR and GBP universe. AUD/CAD and NZD/CAD reveal tops and bottoms to NZD and AUD currencies.\n\nCHF/JPY minus USD/JPY reveals CHF/JPY's target at 115.00's yet this 115.00 target is validated by the MA system.\n\nMore examples to exchange rates by exchange rates\n\nGBP/NZD minus EUR/NZD = GBP/AUD.\n\nEUR/USD minus NZD/CHF = USD/CHF.\n\nUSD/JPY + USD/CHF = EUR/CAD.\n\nGBP/CAD minus EUR/NZD = GBP/CAD.\n\nGBP/NZD minus GBP/CAD = GBP/AUD.\n\nEUR/AUD minus EUR/CAD = GBP/JPY.\n\nGBP/JPY minus USD/JPY = EUR/JPY.\n\nGBP/CAD minus USD/CAD = EUR/CAD.\n\nAUD/NZD minus AUD/USD = AUD/CAD.\n\nAUD/CAD minus AUD/USD = NZD/CAD.\n\nEUR/NZD minus EUR/CAD = EUR/AUD.\n\nUSD/CAD minus CAD/JPY = EUR/CHF.\n\nExchange rates trade far more closer to each other than what is reveled by the eyeball. EUR/CHF for example trades 1.0900 Vs AUD/NZD 1.0756 and a cross-over point at 1.0858."}]}, {"id": "AUD/JPY", "price_data": [83.38500213623047, 83.4020004272461, 83.43000030517578, 83.46800231933594,

Following selloff in Asia, major European indexes open lower and are trading down around -2%. DOW future is also losing around -500pts. Swiss Franc and Yen are overwhelmingly the strongest ones for the day, as followed by Euro and Dollar. Commodity currencies are the worst performing, Focus will now turn to developments in US stocks and yields, on whether they could \u201cbend up \u201d before closing.\n\nTechnically, we\u2019d believe that the key level to watch is 34k handle in DOW, which is slightly below 55 day EMA and medium term trend line support. Sustained break there would at least bring deeper fall back towards 33271.93 support. That might trigger even strong rally in Yen and Franc. However, defending 34k could, at least, help Yen crosses stabilize from the current level.\n\nIn Europe, at the time of writing, FTSE is down -1.93%. DAX is down -2.01%. CAC is down -2.29%. Germany 10-year yield is down -0.014 at -0.308. Earlier in Asia, Nikkei dropped -0.88%. Hong Kong HSI dropped -2.89%. China Shanghai SSE dropped -0.79%. Singapore Strait Times dropped -1.08%. Japan 10-year JGB yield closed flat at 0.028.\n\nUS initial jobless claims rose to 373k, above expectations\n\nUS initial jobless claims rose 2k to 373k in the week ending July 3, above expectation of 355k. Four-week moving average of initial claims dropped -250 to 394.5k, lowest since March 14, 2020.\n\nContinuing claims dropped -145k to 3339k in the week ending June 26, lowest since March 21, 2020. Four-week moving average of continuing claims dropped -44.5k to 3441k, lowest since March 21, 2020.\n\nECB adopts symmetric 2% inflation target negative and positive deviations equally undesirable\n\nECB announced to adopts a symmetric 2% inflation target over medium term. Being symmetric meaning \u201cnegative and positive deviations of inflation from the target are equally undesirable\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhen the economy is operating close to the lower bound on nominal interest rates, it requires especially forceful or persistent monetary policy action to avoid negative deviations from the inflation target becoming entrenched,\u201d ECB said. \u201cThis may also imply a transitory period in which inflation is moderately above target.\u201d\n\nAlso, HICP will remain the appropriate price measures, while the Governing Council recommends inclusion of owner-occupied housing over time.\n\nPresident Christine Lagarde said, \u201cThe new strategy is a strong foundation that will guide us in the conduct of monetary policy in the years to come.\u201d\n\nRBA Lowe wants to see results, not forecast, for rate hikes\n\nIn a speech, RBA Governor Philip Lowe said, it is \u201cnot enough\u201d for inflation to be \u201cforecast\u201d in the rate of 2-3% target for the central bank to lift interest rates. He emphasized, \u201cWe want to see results before we change interest rates\u201d. Also, \u201cthe bond purchases will end prior to any increase in the cash rate\u201d.\n\nHe added that for inflation be sustainably in target rate, it\u2019s like that \u201cwage growth will need to exceed 3 per cent\u201d. It will take \u201cuntil 2024\u201d for inflation to be sustainably within the target range.\n\nLowe also emphasized that \u201cthe condition for an increase in the cash rate depends upon the data, not the date; it is based on inflation outcomes, not the calendar.\u201d Also, the tapering to AUD 4B purchase in bonds a week \u201cdoes not represent a withdrawal of support\u201d.\n\nA look at falling AUD/JPY and GBP/CHF as risk aversion intensifies\n\nRisk aversion comes back again today, as led by the -807pts, or -2.89%, free fall in Hong Kong HSI. In the currency markets, Yen and Swiss Franc are currently the strongest ones.\n\nAUD/JPY breaks through 82.11 support to as low as 81.50 so far, resuming whole decline from 85.78. Rejection by 55 day EMA is a clear sign of near term bearishness. Such decline is seen as correcting the rise from 73.12 for the moment. Hence, we\u2019d look for strong support from 38.2% retracement of 73.12 to 85.78 at 80.94 to contain downside and bring rebound. However, sustained break of 80.94 will argue that it\u2019s indeed correcting whole up trend from 59.85 and target 73.12/78.44 support zone.\n\nGBP/CHF\u2019s sharp fall today now argues that consolidation from 1.2579 might have completed with three waves up to 1.2853. Immediate focus is now on 1.2579/2610 support zone. Decisive break there will confirm this bearish case and target 100% projection of 1.3070 to 1.2579 from 1.2853 at 1.2362. At this point, we\u2019d expect strong support around 1.2259 resistance turned support to contain downside and bring rebound.\n\nUSD/CHF Mid-Day Outlook\n\nDaily Pivots: (S1) 0.9231; (P) 0.9249; (R1) 0.9276; More\u2026.\n\nUSD/CHF falls sharply today but stays above 0.9141 support. Intraday bias remains neutral at this point first. On the downside, firm break of 0.9141 will argue that whole rebound from 0.8925 has completed. Intraday bias will be turned to the downside for 55 day EMA (now at 0.9115). Sustained break there will pave the way back to retest 0.8925 low. On the upside, though, break of 0.9273 will resume the rally to 0.9471 key resistance instead.\n\nIn the bigger picture, medium term outlook is currently neutral with focus on 0.9471 resistance. Sustained break there will indicate completion of whole decline from 1.0342 (2016 high). Medium term outlook will be turned bullish for a test on 1.0342 high. But, rejection by 0.9471 again will revive bearishness for another fall through 0.8756 low.\n\nEconomic Indicators Update"}, {"headline": "AUD/USD, NZD/USD, AUD/JPY Forecast", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Investing.com", "date": "5 hours ago", "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/redesign/images/seo/investingcom_analysis_og.jpg", "author": [], "body": "we wrote: holding below 7510/30 keeps the medium term outlook negative and eventually we should retest last week\u2019s low at 7445\u2026\n\nWe topped at resistance at 7510/30 perfectly as expected to fall another 75 pips.\n\nsell signal was triggered on Monday.

But Asian markets are walking another path, as led by the free fall in Hong Kong stocks. Yen surges broadly on risk aversion, followed by Swiss Franc. Commodity currencies are generally pressured, with Aussie weighed down by dovish RBA comments too. Euro, Sterling and Dollar are mixed for the moment, awaiting ECB minutes for more guidance.\n\nTechnically, USD/JPY\u2019s break of 110.41 support suggest rejection by 111.71 key medium term resistance. It\u2019s also a very early sign of larger bearish reversal. Immediate focus will be on 130.02 support in EUR/JPY to double confirm near term bearishness in Yen crosses. Similarly, AUD/JPY is now eyeing 82.11 support and break will resume the whole fall from 85.78.\n\nIn Asia, Nikkei closed down -0.68%. Hong Kong HSI is down -2.40%. China Shanghai SSE is down -0.78%.

FOMC minutes noted that tapering of asset purchases would happen \u201csomewhat earlier\u201d than expected, after seeing more data over the \u201ccoming months\u201d. Meanwhile, rate hike could also come \u201csomewhat earlier\u201d than expected. The overall messages were largely consistent with the prior statement and projections.\n\nSuggested readings on FOMC minutes:\n\nS&P 500 rose 0.34% or 14.59 pts to close at 4358.13. The current medium term up trend is still on track to 100% projection of 2191.86 to 3588.11 from 3233.94 at 4625.94. In any case, near term outlook will stays bullish as long as 4257.16 support holds, in case of retreat.\n\nHong Kong stocks in free fall on fear of more regulatory crackdown\n\nWhile US stocks were strong, Asian markets are trading notably lower today, as led by the free fall in Hong Kong. Selloff in Chinese tech stocks intensified after the Chinese government announced a step up in oversight on Chinese stocks listing in the US. The announcement came just after the surprised crackdown on ride-hailing giant Didi, days after it\u2019s mega IPO last week.\n\nAt the time of writing, HSI is down -2.5%. Considering the downside momentum, the break of 38.2.% retracement of 21139.26 to 31183.35 at 27346.50 is starting to make outlook bearish. Focus is now on 26782.61 resistance turned support. Sustained break there will suggest that whole rise from 21139.26 has completed at 31183.35 in a corrective three-wave structure.

Intraday bias is turned back to the downside for 55 day EMA (now at 109.79) first. Sustained break there will suggest that it\u2019s at least correcting the whole rise from 102.58, and targets 38.2% retracement of 102.58 to 111.65 at 108.18. For now, risk will be mildly on the downside as long as 111.65 resistance holds, in case of recovery.\n\nIn the bigger picture, medium term outlook is staying neutral with 111.71 resistance intact. Though, as notable support was seen from 55 day EMA, rise from 102.58 is mildly in favor to extend higher. Decisive break of 111.71/112.22 resistance will suggest long term bullish reversal. Rise from 101.18 could then target 118.65 resistance (Dec 2016) and above. However, sustained break of 55 day EMA would revive some medium term bearishness, and open up deep fall back towards 102.58 support.\n\nEconomic Indicators Update"}, {"headline": "AUD/JPY Price Analysis: Offered near 15-week-old support line above 82.00", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "FXStreet", "date": "16 hours ago", "image": "https://editorial.fxstreet.com/images/Markets/Currencies/Crosses/AUDJPY/forex-australia-and-japanese-currency-pair-with-calculator-4780678_Large.jpg", "author": [], "body": "Considering the pair\u2019s downside break of short-term horizontal support, now resistance, coupled with the bearish MACD signals, sellers are likely to keep the reins.

Furthermore, you can see that the market has been in a bit of an up trending channel, so that might be something worth paying attention to as well. All of that being said, if we break down below the \u00a5110 level, we probably have more of a deeper correction ahead. If that is the case, then I would look at that as a potential opportunity to short other currencies against the Japanese yen, not necessarily the US dollar as it has seen so much in the way of upward pressure lately."}, {"headline": "The Australian stock market closed higher at the close; S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.90% from Investing.com", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "QNT", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXMPECB61PM_L.jpg", "author": ["Agnes Zang", "About The Author"], "body": "\u00a9 Reuters.

U.S. markets were closed Monday for the Independence Day holiday.\n\nTuesday's drop came during light summer trading volumes. Thin trading activity can exacerbate volatility, as many investors are on the sidelines.\n\nASIAN STOCKS\n\nJapan's Nikkei Stock Average was down 1.5% at 28203.61, dragged by losses in energy, steel and insurance stocks as the yen strengthened and caution continued over Covid-19 containment measures in Tokyo. USD/JPY was at 110.51, down from 110.81 as of Tuesday's Tokyo stock market close. Investors were focusing on Covid-19 infection trends and any changes to ongoing containment measures in Tokyo.\n\nSouth Korea's Kospi was down 0.6% at 3284.38 in early trading, dragged by construction, travel and retail stocks. Risk-off sentiment was kicking in as growing concerns about the spread of the Covid-19 Delta variant in the country outweighed solid current account data and corporate earnings. USD/KRW rose 0.6% to 1,136.65, sapping investors' appetite for riskier assets such as equities. Index heavyweight Samsung Electronics fell 0.7% despite its above-consensus 2Q preliminary earnings release.\n\nHong Kong stocks fell in morning trade, extending a recent downtrend, as tech shares continued to weigh amid China's latest clampdown on the sector. The Hang Seng TECH Index was 1.4% lower, with Kuaishou lost 3.1% and Meituan was down 2.3%, while Alibaba Group and Tencent Holdings were 1.4% and 1.6% lower, respectively.

The HSI declined 0.9% to 27813.70, having fallen for six straight sessions.\n\nChinese stocks were mixed in morning trade, as the oil sector and software providers weighed while home-appliance makers rose. PetroChina fell 3.0% and Sinopec was 1.4% lower amid a deadlock among OPEC members that has created uncertainty over global crude production. Software companies Sangfor Technologies and iFlytek are 1.9% and 1.6% lower, respectively. Home-appliance makers are rising, with Midea Group 3.8% higher and Haier Smart Home adding 2.8% as analysts say sales appear to be improving. The Shanghai Composite Index was flat at 3529.65, the Shenzhen Composite Index rose 0.6% and the ChiNext Price Index added 1.7%.\n\nFOREX\n\nJPY strengthened against G-10 and Asian currencies amid risk-off sentiment. Risk aversion was the theme but without a single catalyst as a culprit, NAB said. Data has been softer than expected, turmoil in oil markets and China's crackdown on publicly traded companies haven't helped either, while the fall in 10-year Treasury yields was an additional consideration, NAB said, adding that JPY and USD have benefited from a haven bid. USD/JPY fell 0.1% to 110.50, AUD/JPY dropped 0.2% to 82.72 and SGD/JPY edged 0.1% lower to 82.02.\n\nMETALS\n\nGold inched higher in early Asia trade, following a dip in U.S. treasury yields overnight and amid reports indicating that bullion purchases among central banks were gathering steam. Investor demand for the precious metal could rise, following a risk-off tone for equities, ANZ said. Spot gold was 0.1% higher at $1,798.05 an ounce.\n\nOIL SUMMARY\n\nOil rose in Asian trading, after declining overnight amid uncertainty over the outlook for global crude production due to the current OPEC deadlock. CBA said that while the disagreement between the UAE and Saudi Arabia may be an issue in coming OPEC+ meetings, both parties would likely find a resolution. \"We think OPEC+ will eventually agree to boost oil output for the remainder of the year,\" CBA said. Front-month WTI crude oil futures rose 0.2% to $73.48/bbl, while front-month Brent crude oil futures were 0.1% higher at $74.63/bbl.\n\nTOP HEADLINES Samsung Electronics Expects 53% Increase in

Price appears to be hitting a resistance level at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement from the April to June swing high/low. The recent deflection also marks a contact point at a descending resistance trendline stemming from the multi-year swing high back in February.\n\nMoreover, the confirmation of that descending trendline has completed the formation of a Falling Wedge pattern, which gives a bullish bias to the currency pair. Thus, a break above the resistance trendline may result in a breakout. However, prices may continue to range within the limits of the cone-shaped pattern in the short term.\n\nNZD/CAD 8-Hour Chart\n\nChart created with TradingView\n\nNZD/CHF Technical Forecast\n\nThe New Zealand Dollar has also made progress this month against the Swiss Franc, although not to the degree seen against the Canadian Dollar. Month-to-date, NZD/CHF is up just over 0.10%. The currency pair has traded in a Descending Channel since moving lower from a multi-year swing high made in late February.\n\nThe 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level from the February to June high/low appears to be providing a degree of support. A break lower would see price approach the rising 200-day SMA. Alternatively, the upper limit of the downward channel poses the most immediate resistance level. If price were to break above that level, the 38.2% Fib and the 100-day SMA present technical barriers.\n\nNZD/CHF 8-Hour Chart\n\nChart created with TradingView\n\nAUD/NZD Technical Forecast\n\nThe New Zealand Dollar has strengthened against the Australian Dollar, with AUD/NZD on track to drop for a fourth consecutive week. The currency pair has traded within a Descending Channel since the June swing high. Support and resistance within the downward channel have been seen throughout the Fibonacci levels set from the May to June high/low.\n\nFurthermore, overhead pressure from the descending 26-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA). If price remains on the current downward path, the 78.6% Fib level is the next barrier to clear before moving lower. Beyond that level puts the May swing low in view. MACD is indicating continued pressure to the downside, although the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is rebounding above its oversold level.\n\nAUD/NZD 8-Hour Chart\n\nChart created with TradingView\n\nNew Zealand Dollar TRADING RESOURCES\n\n--- Written by Thomas Westwater, Analyst for DailyFX.com\n\nTo contact Thomas, use the comments section below or @FxWestwater on Twitter"}, {"headline": "AUD/NZD Up 2 Pips in Last Hour, Entered Today Down For the 6th Consecutive Day; in a Downtrend Over Past 14 Days", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "CFDTrading", "date": "14 hours ago", "image": "https://www.cfdtrading.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/cfdtrading-l2.png", "author": [], "body": "Hourly Update\n\n(Last Updated July 8, 2021 1:45 GMT)\n\nCurrently, AUDNZD\u2019s rate is up 2 pips (0.02%) from the hour prior. It\u2019s been a feast for bulls operating on an hourly timeframe, as AUDNZD has now gone up 4 of the past 5 hours. If you\u2019re a trend trader, consider that the strongest clear trend on the hourly chart exists on the 50 hour timeframe. Price action traders may also wish to note that we see a doji candlestick pattern on AUDNZD. Given that we see downtrend on the 20 hourly candle timeframe, and that such candlestick patterns often denote reversals, this may be worth noting. The moving averages on the hourly timeframe suggest a choppiness in price, as the are all in a mixed alignment \u2014 meaning the trend across timeframes is inconsistent, indicating a potential opportunity for rangebound traders.\n\nAUDNZD End of Day Recap\n\nUpdated 00:30 GMT (04:30 EST)\n\nAUDNZD is down 6 pips (0.05%) since the previous day (opening today near 1.06695), marking the 6th consecutive day it has gone down. Relative to other instruments in the Forex asset class, AUDNZD ranked 21st the previous day in terms of percentage price change. Here is a price chart of AUDNZD.\n\nAUDNZD Technical Analysis\n\nComing into today AUDNZD is now close to its 20, 50, 100 and 200 day moving averages, which may act as price barrier for the asset. As for the alignment of the moving averages, well, it\u2019s a bit mixed up; the 20, 50, 100, and 200 do not progress from largest to smallest, or vice versa. The closest is the 200 day average, which is 52.8 pips away. Trend traders will want to observe that the strongest trend appears on the 14 day horizon; over that time period, price has been moving down. Or to simplify this another way, note that out of the past 14 days AUDNZD\u2019s price has gone down 11 them.\n\nThe View From Around the Web\n\nNot much in terms quality buy/sell signals we\u2019re seeing for AUDNZD; just 0 sell signals and 1 buy signals.

AUD/USD roundtripped from 0.7485 to 0.7534 and back to settle lower around the 0.7460 handle. The NZD was a similar story, once again dipping below 0.7000 to 0.6990 before settling around 0.7015. AUD/NZD continued its slide lower to reach a one-month low at 1.0671.\n\nYesterday\u2019s FOMC minutes were the key release of the day and delivered no surprises to markets. Although QE tapering was raised, there was no evidence of urgency from the Fed in slowing down the pace of bond purchases. The message of needing to see \u2018substantial further progress\u2019 on the economic front was a continuation of previous messaging.\n\nLooking ahead to today, RBA governor Lowe is set to speak about both the labour market and monetary policy. The speech will be delivered to the Economic Society of Australia at 12:30pm and will be watched closely by markets that are expecting him to reiterate the cautious optimism he mentioned earlier in the week. Topside targets can be seen at 0.7500 and 0.7590 whilst the daily low of 0.7445 represents the first lines of support.\n\nKey Movers\n\nDespite a relatively flat Wednesday there was some movement in Europe that saw the euro decline to a three-month low against the greenback. Falling to as low as 1.1781, the euro traded to a variety of variables. Domestically, the euro succumbed to less than impressive macroeconomic figures with May\u2019s Industrial Production falling well below expectations. This was somewhat counteracted by the close however by optimism after the FOMC minutes which buoyed risk assets including the euro. Overall, the euro opens this morning at 1.1798.\n\nIt was a similar story across the channel with the sterling see-sawing through the session to close relatively unchanged. Domestically, UK macroeconomic data failed to impress with the June Halifax Price Index contracting by 0.5% MoM and missing the market's expectations. Adding fuel to the fire was also another 32,000 COVID-19 cases (the biggest single-day increase since January) which further undermined local optimism. The sterling nevertheless traded at the whims of the FOMC and remains relatively unchanged despite a rollercoaster day to open this morning at 1.3803.\n\nExpected Ranges\n\nAUD/USD: 0.7445 - 0.7520 \u25bc\n\n\n\nGBP/AUD: 1.8350 - 1.8550 \u25b2\n\n\n\nAUD/NZD: 1.0640 - 1.0710 \u25bc\n\n\n\nAUD/EUR: 0.6320 - 0.6370 \u25b2\n\n\n\nAUD/CAD: 0.9320 - 0.9380 \u25b2"}, {"headline": "Asian Open: Wall Street Sets New Highs After FOMC-Minutes", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "City Index", "date": "19 hours ago", "image": "https://www.cityindex.co.uk/~/media/research/global/news-analysis/featured-image/stocks3.jpg", "author": ["Stonex Financial Ltd", "Matt Simpson"], "body": "Asian Futures:\n\nAustralia's ASX 200 futures are down 0 points (0%), the cash market is currently estimated to open at 7,326.90\n\nJapan's Nikkei 225 futures are down -50 points (-0.18%), the cash market is currently estimated to open at 28,316.95\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng futures are down -6 points (-0.02%), the cash market is currently estimated to open at 27,954.62\n\nUK and Europe:\n\nUK's FTSE 100 index rose 50.14 points (0.71%) to close at 7,151.02\n\nEurope's Euro STOXX 50 index rose 25.86 points (0.64%) to close at 4,078.53\n\nGermany's DAX index rose 181.33 points (1.17%) to close at 15,692.71\n\nFrance's CAC 40 index rose 20.24 points (0.31%) to close at 6,527.72\n\nWednesday US Close:\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial rose 53.62 points (0.16%) to close at 33,730.89\n\nThe S&P 500 index rose 14.59 points (0.34%) to close at 4,358.13\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 index rose 24.178 points (0.16%) to close at 14,810.54\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn how to trade indices\n\n\n\n\n\nIndices like the lack of tapering:\n\nThe Fed were more balanced than some had hoped, according to the minutes of FOMC meeting released overnight.

So not the most decisive of sessions but with volatility comes opportunity.\n\nCAD and EUR were the weakest currencies, GBP and NZD were the strongest. Which is a shame for the Canadian dollar because its Ivey PMI report came in much stronger than expected, rising 71.9 from 64.7 (versus 57.4 forecast). Ultimately, weaker oil prices remain the headwind for CAD and also explain why it is the weakest major currency over the past week.\n\nThe US dollar index (DXY) touched a new 3-month high overnight and hit our gap resistance target, before reverting lower to leave some sort of hammer/Doji hybrid. However, it is not a close which denotes extreme-bullish strength, so perhaps majors have some wriggle room for minor gains against the dollar today.\n\nAUD/USD closed beneath its 200-day eMA for a 7th day but is struggling to close beneath the December 21st low. Support levels reside at 0.7443 and 0.7400 with resistance at 0.7580 and 0.7537. AUD/NZD hit a month-to-date low, and bearish momentum increased after finding resistance at its 200-day eMA.\n\nNZD/CAD found support at the 0.8770 breakout level yet also formed a double top at 0.8780. Our bias remains bullish above Tuesday\u2019s low with the initial target being around the 0.8852 high / 200-day eMA.\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn how to trade forex\n\n\n\n\n\nCommodities: Oil falls over -6% from its highs\n\nThe lack of OPEC clarity continued to weigh on oil prices for second day. WTI hit our near-term bearish target of 72.0 and Brent futures fell a further -2.2% to take its two-day fall to -6.6% from its 2.5 year high.\n\nAn early rebound saw resistance found around its weekly pivot and broken trendline, before accelerating to the downside and dipping below 73.00, to settle at 73.14. Given momentum remain favourable to bears, we are on the lookout for bearish reversal patterns around resistance zones. Should volatility remain low for a move towards 74-74.40 then perhaps bears can regain control.\n\nGold rose 0.4% despite a slightly strong US dollar, taking its lead from lower bond yields instead. It formed a bullish inside day which closed above 1800 yet beneath its 200-day eMA. Silver was effectively flat and formed a indecisive Doji, showing the market currently lacks direction.\n\nCopper futures also printed a bullish inside day, failing to break beneath $4.20 support to confirm the next leg lower after printing a bearish hammer on Tuesday. We continue to watch that key level for a potential break, whilst a break above 4.4350 suggests bulls are regaining control.\n\n\n\n\n\nUp Next (Times in AEST)\n\nYou can view all the scheduled events for today using our economic calendar, and keep up to date with the latest market news and analysis here.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to trade with City Index\n\nFollow these easy steps to start trading with City Index today:"}, {"headline": "FxWirePro: AUD/NZD capped at 5-DMA, further weakness on cards", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "EconoTimes", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/uploads/20210707e4227e460d4e90800_th_1024x0.png", "author": [], "body": "AUD/NZD chart - Trading View\n\nTechnical Analysis: Bias Bearish\n\n- AUD/NZD has edged higher from session lows at 1.0672 and was trading at 1.0683 at around 10:40 GMT\n\n- Daily cloud capped recovery attempts and the pair is grinding lower along 5-DMA\n\n- Price action is extending weakness below 200-DMA and is trading below 200H MA\n\n- Volatility is high and rising as evidenced by widening Bollinger bands\n\n- ADX is rising with -ve DMI dominance in support of downside, MACD is below zero\n\n- Momentum is bearish, RSI is well below 50 mark, Stochs are at oversold levels\n\n- GMMA indicator shows major and minor trend are bearish on the daily charts\n\nSupport levels - 1.0683 (110-week EMA), 1.0625 (Channel base), 1.06 (May 27 low)\n\nResistance levels - 1.0695 (5-DMA), 1.0716 (200-DMA), 1.0725 (21-EMA)\n\nSummary: Souring market sentiment amid rising coronavirus cases of the Delta variant keep the antipodeans depressed.

Thus, a further decline towards the next relevant support region around the 0.7400 mark seems like a close possibility.\n\nSome investors would still be looking at the US bond yields and the broader market risk sentiment to see how it influence the Greenback\u2019s price dynamics.

The decline in net-long position has done little to alleviate the tilt in retail sentiment as 50.81% of traders were net-long AUD/USD last week, while the drop in net-short interest comes as the exchange rate trades to a fresh yearly low (0.7417) in July.\n\nWith that said, the weakness in AUD/USD may continue to coincide with the shift in retail sentiment like the behavior seen earlier this year, and looming developments in the Relative Strength Index (RSI) may show the bearish momentum gathering pace as it tracks the downward trend established in May and approaches oversold territory.\n\nAUD/USD Rate Daily Chart\n\nSource: Trading View\n\nKeep in mind, a head-and-shoulders formation took shape earlier this year as AUD/USD traded to a fresh 2021 low (0.7532) in April, but the exchange rate negated the key reversal pattern following the failed attempts to close below the neckline around 0.7560 (50% expansion) to 0.7570 (78.6% retracement) .\n\nHowever, AUD/USD sits below the 200-Day SMA (0.7572) for the first time in over a year, with the decline in the exchange rate pushing the Relative Strength Index (RSI) into oversold territory for the first time since March 2020.\n\nL ooming developments in the RSI may show the bearish momentum gathering pace as it tracks the downward trend established in May , with a move below 30 in the oscillator likely to be accompanied by a further decline in the exchange rate like the price action s een during the previous month .\n\nA close below the Fibonacci overlap around 0.7440 (23.6% expansion) to 0.7500 (50% retracement) brings the 0.7370 (38.2% expansion) to 0.7380 (61.8% retracement) region on the radar, with a move below the December 2020 low (0.7338) opening up the 0.7180 (61.8% retracement) to 0.7210 (78.6% retracement) area.\n\n--- Written by David Song, Currency Strategist\n\nFollow me on Twitter at @DavidJSong"}, {"headline": "AUD/USD Falls Ahead of Employment Change News", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "", "date": "4 hours ago", "image": "https://mlmhhbc485aw.i.optimole.com/ltER-78-uHsqMcI7/w:auto/h:auto/q:90/https://fxdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/building-804526_640.jpg", "author": ["Usman Ahmed"], "body": "The AUD/USD currency pair is being asked today at 0.7437, and it has lowered itself on the graph with the red candle label.\n\nSince the beginning of the month, the AUD/USD pair has been deteriorating and losing value day by day.\n\nAn update might harm the price, this instance concerning the scheduling of incoming days with poor forecasted reports.\n\nOn Thursday, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) will announce employment change data for Australia (July 15, 2021).

An increase in the number of employed individuals boosts the country\u2019s economic growth and increases consumer spending.

Robert Also Works In Private Finance With Investors", "Companies Delivering Financial", "Management Services."], "body": "The AUD/USD has fallen towards long-term support as the Forex pair extends its slump which technically began in the middle of May.\n\nThe AUD/USD has seen its value decrease in a swift manner the past couple of days. On the 6th of July, the AUD/USD was trading near the 76.00000 ratio, but as of this writing the Forex pair is near 74.30000. The current values of the AUD/USD are within the vicinity of support levels last seen in early December of 2020. Speculative bulls may feel quite attracted to the current price of the AUD/USD, but they need to be careful about blindly placing wagers on long positions.\n\nOn the 25th of February, the AUD/USD was trading briefly near a high of 80.00000, but since this date the Forex pair has produced choppy and incremental bearish pressure. Yes, the highs of May did approach the 79.00000 ratio, but this was not able to be sustained. Support near the 74.00000 should be watched carefully now; if it manages to prove durable, this may be an indication that the Australian dollar has been oversold.\n\nThe last time the AUD/USD traded below the 74.0000 level was in November of 2020. On the first of November and earlier into September of 2020, the 70.00000 proved to be rather adequate support. Before bearish traders contemplate these lower depths however, they might want to take into consideration the notion that the slump in the AUD/USD has happened on the back of nervous sentiment due to U.S central bank policy whispers.\n\nFrom a speculative standpoint, traders who feel the AUD/USD has been oversold in the short term and want to wager on buying positions cannot be faulted. Yes, this would be going against the trend, but if a trader uses solid stop loss ratios near current support levels, this could prove to be a rather intriguing short-term wager. Conservative traders may want to wait for additional moves lower and the 74.10000 mark to be seen before stepping into long positions.\n\nSpeculators who want to continue selling the AUD/USD cannot be blamed. The trend has certainly been bearish, but these traders should not be overly greedy and use take-profit orders to make sure they do not watch profits vanish on potentially sharp reversals.\n\nAUD/USD Short-Term Outlook:\n\nCurrent Resistance: 74.80000\n\nCurrent Support: 74.10000\n\nHigh Target: 75.40000\n\nLow Target: 73.82000"}, {"headline": "", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Capital.com",

(BTC/USD) continued to confound traders early in today\u2019s Asian session as traders await fresh market direction following extended sideways trading activity that has seen the pair confined to a relatively tight range. Traders recently encountered technical resistance around the 35951 level, representing a test of the 78.6% retracement of the recent depreciating range from 36675 to 32703.48. During the recent consolidation, bids emerged around the 33156.86 area, representing the 78.6% retracement of the appreciating range from 32703.48 to 35951.

Eventually, it breaks out of the range, in the direction of its previous trend, and falls by as much as the maximum distance between Triangle\u2019s upper and lower trendline.\n\nWhy $30,000?\n\nBitcoin was trending inside a similar Triangle-like consolidation pattern until it ultimately broke below the structure\u2019s lower trendline. As a result, the flagship cryptocurrency\u2019s probability of shifting its downside target near $30,000 increased. That is partly because the structure\u2019s maximum height was shy of $2,550, and subtracting it from the point of breakout (~$33,878) lands the price objective near $31,308.\n\nBitcoin formed a sequence of bearish and bullish reversal structures as it consolidated between the $30,000\u2013$40,000 price range. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bearish setup also surfaced as Bitcoin tested $32,334 as its interim support in Thursday\u2019s early London session. A minor bounce ensued that took the price above $32,600. However, the rebound lacked additional upside conviction owing to a bearish divergence between prices and volumes, suggesting that Bitcoin might resume its trend to the downside.\n\nPeter Brandt, chief executive of Factor LLC \u2014 a global trading firm \u2014 also suggested a decline toward $30,000, albeit using a different indicator. The veteran trader spotted BTC/USD exchange rates inside a rectangular pattern, a price block that has lately been keeping Bitcoin in a medium-term bias conflict.\n\nBitcoin stuck inside a rectangle. Source: Twitter/Peter Brandt\n\nThe price traded midway through the rectangle upon pulling back from its upper trendline resistance. Such a move typically prompts the spot BTC/USD rate to fall toward the lowest rectangle support level, which coincided with $30,000.\n\nFundamentals\n\nUnsupportive macroeconomic fundamentals, in part, fueled the latest Bitcoin price drop.\n\nThe primary among them was the minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s gathering that came out Wednesday around 14:30 EST. As expected, the United States central bank officials suggested that they might end up pulling back their support of the economy sooner than they had expected.\n\n\u201cVarious participants mentioned that they expected the conditions for beginning to reduce the pace of asset purchases to be met somewhat earlier than they had anticipated at previous meetings in light of incoming data,\u201d the minutes read.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's new dot plot expects rate hikes in 2023. Source: Bloomberg\n\nBitcoin tends to benefit from loose monetary policies.\n\nThe cryptocurrency surged from as low as $3,858 in March 2020 to as high as $65,000 in mid-April 2021 as the Fed slashed its benchmark lending rates to near zero, thus affecting the U.S. dollar\u2019s purchasing power, and started buying government bonds and mortgage-backed securities at the rate of $120 billion per month, pushing down yields.\n\nFor clarity, central banks\u2019 asset purchase programs cause inflationary pressures, for they expect to monetize a part of the government\u2019s deficit spending. Such purchases tend to inflate prices of equities and fixed-income investments. Coupled with cheaper lending, the loose monetary programs increase fiat liquidity in the system, boosting Bitcoin\u2019s \u201csuperior store of value\u201d narrative against an unlimited dollar supply.\n\nAs a result, investors started shifting to riskier safe-haven assets, including Bitcoin, to seek better returns. But as soon as the fears of the Fed\u2019s tapering grew over markets, Bitcoin started declining. On Wednesday, Bitcoin\u2019s move lower from above $35,000 came right after the central bank\u2019s minutes went public.\n\nBitcoin reacts negatively to the Fed's June minutes. Source: TradingView\n\nJohn Miller, a financial analyst associated with Seeking Alpha, noted that the Fed\u2019s hawkish notions offset chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s aim to ensure strong long-term monetary accommodation. In the latest minutes as well, Powell called the U.S. economic recovery weak, citing weak job growth in June.\n\n\u201cThe Fed\u2019s accommodative balance sheet policy will continue to support elevated liquidity in the banking system and backstop asset prices,\u201d Miller wrote.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrencies and crypto assets with strong store of value dynamics, such as Bitcoin, will excel in this environment.\u201d\n\nAlexey Veledinskii, product owner at cryptocurrency spot and derivatives exchange Digitex, anticipated Bitcoin to hold $30,000 on persistent inflation concerns. He said:\n\n\u201cMajor support at $30,000 can easily be flipped with a rebound to more ambitious price points toward $50,000 to $70,000 in the mid to longer-term.\u201d\n\nThe views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

However, the crash was larger for Litecoin, as it lost exactly 70% of its value, while Bitcoin only lost a bit more than 50%.\n\nThe situation since the crash seems worse for Litecoin as well, with a clear downward trend in the price, while Bitcoin has mostly been trading sideways for about two months. BITCOIN has formed a bottom at around $30,000 which is a solid support zone, despite having been pierced once.\n\nBitcoin Live Chart\n\nBTC/USD\n\nAt the top, the 20 SMA (gray) has been acting as resistance. For Bitcoin, the top of the range was above $40,000 until June, but last month, the 20 SMA (gray) has been pushing the highs lower for BTC/USD after it caught up with the price. This is not a good sign, since the smallest moving average has already turned into resistance. But, at least the support zone is remaining horizontal.\n\nThe daily chart for LITECOIN looks more bearish than for Bitcoin. Sellers broke below the May low of $120, dropping to $105, while the highs are getting lower at a faster pace than is the case with Bitcoin. This week, Litecoin failed to resume its bullish trend, and it is now reversing down after finding resistance at the 20 daily SMA.\n\nThe range is getting narrower for Litecoin\n\nThe range is getting tighter by the day, as the 20 SMA keeps pushing the highs lower, so the chances are that the break to the downside will happen soon. Now the stochastic indicator is heading down, so let\u2019s see when the break comes in LTC/USD.

Therefore, we can expect BTC/USD to move higher again and regain some of the overnight loss.\n\nCryptocurrency heat map. Source: Coin360\n\nThe overall market trades with a strong bearish momentum over the last 24 hours. Bitcoin has decreased by 6.5 percent, while Ethereum almost 10 percent. The rest of the market has seen a similar loss of 6-9 percent.\n\nBitcoin price movement in the last 24 hours\n\nBTC/USD traded in a range of $32,133 \u2013 $34,997, indicating strong volatility. Trading volume has increased by almost 2 percent and totals $28.25 billion. Meanwhile, the total market capitalization trades around 610.8 billion, resulting in market dominance of 44.33 percent.\n\nBTC/USD 4-hour chart \u2013 BTC spikes lower again\n\nOn the 4-hour chart, we can see the Bitcoin price experiencing a sharp decline over the past hours, indicating that some of it will be regained later today.\n\nThe overall market structure has become bearish again after the several-week ascending support trendline was broken, and a lower high was set around the $35,000 mark. This resulted from a failed move higher earlier this week as the $36,000 prevented further upside for Bitcoin.\n\nFrom there, BTC/USD traded along with the several-day moving average, with a higher local sing low set. However, a sharp spike lower was seen yesterday, resulting in further downside over the past hours.\n\nSupport currently can be seen around the $32,000 mark as a minor rejection for further upside has built up. Therefore, we are likely BTC/USD to regain some of the loss over the past days and set a lower high from which to continue declining later next week, with the next major support area around $31,000.\n\nBitcoin Price Analysis: Conclusion\n\nBitcoin price analysis is bullish for today as the market has retraced considerably over the last 24 hours, and a reversal to regain some of the loss can be expected later today. Therefore, we will likely see BTC/USD move back above the $33 mark and set another lower high.\n\nWhile waiting for Bitcoin to regain some of the loss, read our guides on DeFi advantages, Bitcoin fees, what you can buy with Bitcoin.\n\nDisclaimer.

To boil it down to one factor: Positioning. Over the last several months, many markets have become one-way trades, attracting trend-following speculators and leading to excessive positioning in several of the planet\u2019s most-traded assets. Essentially, when \u201ceveryone\u201d has bought into an established trend, there are relatively few traders left to join the trend and drive it further along, making the trending market vulnerable to a violent reversal, even if there\u2019s no new market-moving news.

It may be worth observing that CADJPY was the worst performer of the 39 members in the Forex asset class over the past day.

As for the alignment of the moving averages, well, it\u2019s a bit mixed up; the 20, 50, 100, and 200 do not progress from largest to smallest, or vice versa. The closest is the 100 day average, which is 66.3 pips away. Trend traders will want to observe that the strongest trend appears on the 90 day horizon; over that time period, price has been moving up. Interestingly, a trend in the other direction exists on the 30 day timeframe, where price is headed down. Or to simplify this another way, note that out of the past 30 days CADJPY\u2019s price has gone down 18 them. We\u2019re also seeing a bearish engulfing pattern form over the past two candles, which suggests the uptrend on the 90 and 30 day"}, {"headline": "CAD/JPY Increases Ahead of Canadian Unemployment Rate", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://mlmhhbc485aw.i.optimole.com/ltER-78-uHsqMcI7/w:auto/h:auto/q:90/https://fxdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/building-804526_640.jpg", "author": ["Usman Ahmed"], "body": "After a two-day slide, the Canadian dollar (CAD) edged higher Wednesday, trading at above 0.7000 against the Japanese Yen (JPY).\n\nIt almost remains positive since the pair\u2019s value indicates a higher peak in the current upward movement.

US equities notched fresh all-time-highs and US Dollar bears made their mark in the first two months of the quarter, with a notable pullback showing in June around the FOMC rate decision.\n\nBut, it was at that same rate decision that kickstarted a round of US Dollar strength that FOMC Chair, Jerome Powell, said that market participants should take the dot plot matrix and the Fed\u2019s forecasts with a grain of salt. That\u2019s what helped to really propel stocks, and risk assets, as it became clear once again that the world\u2019s largest national central bank is backstopping markets and apparently happy to continue doing so.\n\nThis does create some interesting dynamics elsewhere, however, such as around the Japanese Yen and the Canadian Dollar.\n\nThe Bank of Canada created some surprise in April when they became one of the first globalized central banks to start talking about post-pandemic policy. This led to a strong run of Canadian Dollar strength that was similarly supported by rising oil prices. The Bank of Japan, however, continues to hold negative rates as they have since 2016. And there appears to be little sign of anything changing on that front, even as a potential shift appears ahead of or around the Federal Reserve.\n\nThis has supported a strong trend in CAD/JPY that\u2019s propelled the pair up to fresh three-year-highs. And very nearby is an important watermark, plotted at 91.64 which is the current five-year high in the pair.\n\nCAD/JPY Monthly Price Chart\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; CADJPY on Tradingview\n\nCAD/JPY Bullish Breakout Potential\n\nA big technical item took place in CAD/JPY during the month of May when price action broke above a descending trendline that\u2019s connecting 2018 and 2014 swing highs. This also came along with a test above the psychological 90 level.\n\nThis keeps the door open for bullish breakout potential ahead of the Q3 open, and this can be followed by first looking for a test of the five-year-high plotted at 91.64, after which another interesting spot opens on the chart around 93.25. If buyers can push through here, then the 95.00 psychological level would be the next big spot to follow.\n\nCAD/JPY Weekly Price Chart\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; CADJPY on Tradingview\n\n---

trading\n\n\n\n\n\nUSD/CAD was up earlier to a high of 1.2449 but is now tracking lower to the lows for the day at 1.2418 as the loonie regains some momentum after a sluggish week against the dollar, despite higher oil prices in the lead up to the OPEC+ decision.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat may tell us quite a bit of how solid the dollar's performance has been and from a technical perspective, it has seen USD/CAD break above 1.2400 and even its 100-day moving average (red line) once again - after having briefly done so in June.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast month, the break against the latter technical level was short-lived as buyers failed to get close to contest the 1.2500 level and so the highs then @ 1.2481-87 offers a key resistance region going into the US jobs report later today.\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the hawkish tilt by the BOC, you'd have to figure that the latest bounce since mid-June owes much to a technical rejection of 1.2000 at its first attempt.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut if the BOC is going to play it slow now that the Fed itself is starting to turn the other cheek, then loonie gains may be less straightforward to come by than it was in the opening five months of the year.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we break back above 1.2500, I can see this heading towards the 200-day moving average (blue line) @ 1.2670 next.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat said, with the BOC likely to push forward with its agenda, the Canadian economy looking more optimistic, and oil prices to stay more upbeat, it is tough to fit the solid fundamental backdrop that is supporting the loonie at the moment.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs mentioned before, on the balance of things, I would argue that USD/CAD is likely headed towards another test of 1.2000 but that conviction isn't what it was pre-FOMC.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe technical element now is also part of the consideration, with dollar gains ahead of the payrolls later adding to the recent upside pressure in the pair.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs such, as mentioned before, there is a stronger argument that this latest shift in the landscape calls for a stronger loonie against the likes of the franc and yen in the long-term, given rate differentials and policy/economic divergence.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut of course, timing is everything so be wary of potential retracements considering how CAD/JPY was already the best performer in 1H 2021."}]}, {"id": "CHF/JPY", "price_data": [117.75399780273438, 117.9209976196289,

But with the labour force rising by just 151,000 and still more than three million below its pre-pandemic peak, we aren\u2019t entirely convinced that this is the start of a much stronger trend,\u201d says Andrew Hunter at independent research and consultancy Capital Economics.\n\n\u201cThe key event next week will be the release of the minutes from the Fed\u2019s June meeting, which are likely to provide more details of discussions about asset purchase tapering,\u201d Hunter adds.\n\nWednesday\u2019s minutes are set to hit the wires hard on the heels of June\u2019s non-farm payrolls report, which showed employment rising by almost 1 million last month and lifted the six-month rolling average of payrolls growth to a robust 481k.\n\nAbove: Pound-to-Dollar rate shown at daily intervals with Fibonacci retracements of Feb-to-June rally indicating support levels, alongside selected moving-averages.\n\nAchieve up to 3-5% more currency for your money transfers.

The calendar is quite light, with the highlight probably being the release of the FOMC minutes on Wednesday evening. Much focus will be given to how the doves and hawks are arguing their cases,\u201d Turner adds.\n\nThe Dollar ended last week on its back foot even after Friday\u2019s payrolls surprise, enabling the Pound-Dollar rate to rise back above a 1.38 handle that had appeared in danger of ceding and potentially indicating the directional bias of the U.S. currency ahead of this Wednesday\u2019s minutes, although it\u2019s the market\u2019s reading of and response to the minutes that will dictate how and where GBP/USD ends the week.\n\nThe risk is that Wednesday\u2019s meeting notes bring attention back to bear on the Fed\u2019s $120 billion per month quantitative easing (QE) programme and questions about what would be the most appropriate time to begin winding it down and the pace at which such an exercise should be carried out; potentially leading to increased bond yields and, or a bid for the Dollar in the latter half of the week.\n\nAbove: Pound-to-Dollar rate shown at daily intervals with Fibonacci retracements of correction from early June highs and key moving-averages indicating possible areas resistance to any recovery.\n\n\u201cThe US fiscal stimulus is by far the largest in G10, helping the US outgrow the rest of the world and likely supporting USD this year and possibly next. The Fed is on track to announce tapering at an upcoming meeting, and we continue to think the September meeting is most likely, with tapering starting at the turn of the year,\u201d says Michalis Rousakis, a strategist at BofA Global Research.\n\n\u201cOur key difference with the consensus is that we expect the USD to rally against currencies of central banks that will not be normalizing policies, including EUR, CHF, JPY and SEK, but not necessarily against the rest. Indeed, this is exactly how G10 FX has performed this year, with CAD, GBP, USD and NOK at the top, JPY, CHF, SEK and EUR at the bottom, and AUD and NZD in the middle,\u201d Rousakis adds.\n\nThe Dollar has been lifted in the last month by a lessening of bearish sentiments toward it which was brought about by evolving expectations for Fed policy, with investors and traders increasingly wagering that the bank could raise its interest rate before the end of next year, before lifting it back to 1% by the end of 2023 even as Chairman Jerome Powell poured cold water over other policymakers\u2019 suggestions that any changes to interest rates are in any way likely within this time period.\n\nAbove: Goldman Sachs graph showing market expectations for changes in major central bank policy rats (BoE in red).\n\n\u201cThere are still a number of open questions around the Fed\u2019s balance sheet, including the taper announcement timeline, the duration of the tapering process, and whether the committee will rule out rate hikes while the balance sheet is still growing,\u201d says Zach Pandl, co-head of global foreign exchange strategy at Goldman Sachs.\n\nProspects for U.S. interest rates have dominated the market conversation even as Chairman Powell and others made clear in June that the Fed\u2019s policy priority is the government bond buying programme and its eventual, gradual winding down, details of which may or may not be revealed by Wednesday\u2019s meeting minutes: To the extent that these do reveal anything about the likely timing of a decision by the Fed to reduce its footprint in the U.S. government bond market they will determine whether the Pound-Dollar rate holds onto or gives up the 1.38 handle ahead of Friday\u2019s GDP report.\n\n\u201cMinutes from the June 15-16 FOMC meeting, released on Wednesday, may help clarify Fed officials\u2019 views on the exit path.

In this environment, the dollar gains are likely to be concentrated against currencies where central banks will be even slower to tighten monetary policy.\n\nBNP looks at longer-term trends from economic cycles and notes that the dollar tends to strengthen ahead of Federal Reserve interest rate increases before weakening once rates actually increase.\n\n\u201cUSD gains are likely to be most pronounced versus currencies where the market cannot price a meaningful exit from easy monetary policy, notably the CHF, JPY and EUR.\u201d\n\nThe Euro to Dollar (EUR/USD) exchange rate is forecast to weaken to 1.1400 at the end of 2022.\n\nExport Earnings Boost Commodity Currencies\n\nAs the global economy tends to normalise, BNP expects there will be investor support for currencies where there are strong commodity earnings or interest rates are expected to increase.\n\n\u201cIn contrast, we expect a number of emerging market and G10 currencies with commodity exposure or where central banks are likely to hike in tandem with \u2013 or ahead of \u2013 the Fed to hold up well and even outperform the USD.\u201d\n\nIn this context, it expects that commodity currencies will maintain a firm tone and hold their own against the US currency.\n\nPound Sterling (GBP) Exchange Rates Remain Attractive\n\nBNP remains constructive surrounding the Pound Sterling outlook. The bank expects that there is scope for UK yields to increase further as the Bank of England is likely to be one of the early movers in removing policy accommodation.\n\n\u201cComparing the market pricing for rate hikes across the G10, the Bank of England looks conservatively priced, especially considering its less-restrictive forward guidance.\u201d\n\nUK assets continued to under-perform in the 2016-2020 period as Brexit uncertainty curb investor inflows. According to BNP, there is scope for a further catch-up effect over the next few months.\n\n\u201cWe also maintain our positive view on UK equities, as these have lagged the broader rotation into Value stocks, and this could benefit the GBP.\u201d\n\nThe Euro to Pound (EUR/GBP) exchange rate is forecast to weaken to 0.83 at the end of 2022.\n\nAbove: Table of currency forecasts from BNP Paribas covering period 2021-2022."}, {"headline": "Exchange rates predict exchange rates: USD/JPY and JPY cross pairs", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "FXStreet", "date": "1 week ago", "image": "https://editorial.fxstreet.com/images/Markets/Currencies/Majors/USDJPY/usdjpy_Large.jpg", "author": [], "body": "For the second instance over the past 4 weeks, all JPY cross pairs are at, near, or broke vital support points.
