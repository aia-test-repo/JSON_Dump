[{"headline": "Focus Might Turns to Euro Selling While Dollar Rally Capped by Strong Risk Appetite", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Action Forex", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://www.actionforex.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/f-eur9-e1600272705134.jpg", "author": [], "body": "Dollar ended as the strongest one last week but Friday\u2019s steel fall after solid non-farm payroll job reports suggests that it\u2019s rally is already losing steam. It\u2019s still a bit early to call a bearish reversal for the greenback. Yet, strong risk-on sentiments could cap Dollar\u2019s upside attempts ahead, and even trigger a deeper pull back.\n\nEuro ended as the second weakest, next to Aussie, but the late development in EUR/AUD suggests that the favor is not on Euro\u2019s side. More importantly, developments in some crosses like EUR/CHF and EUR/CAD indicates that market focuses might turn to selling in Euro in crosses ahead. On the other hand, the late rebound in Canadian Dollar opens up some upside prospects for the near term.\n\nNASDAQ closed at new record, heading to 15k handle\n\nNASDAQ\u2019s up trend continued last wee after some hesitation, and finished with a strong close at new record high of 14639.32. Near term outlook will remain bullish as long as 14439.90 supports. Next target is 61.8% projection of 10822.57 to 14175.11 from 13002.53 at 15074.39.\n\nThat would be an important level to overcome as it\u2019s firstly close to 15k handle. More importantly, a strong break of 15k could put weekly MACD back into a rising track. That would in turn argues that NASDAQ is back in medium term up side acceleration. Strong break of 15k would set the stage for even more powerful rise in this 2H of the year.\n\nDOW to catch to resume record run.\n\nDOW also made some notable progress even though it\u2019s still lagging behind S&P 500 and NASDAQ. Current development argues that consolidation pattern from 35091.56 has already completed at 33271.93, after brief breach of medium term channel support.\n\nDOW could take on 35091.56 record high this week, and break will confirm resumption of larger up trend from 18213.65. Next target would be 100% projection of 18213.65 to 2919935 from 26143.77 at 37129.47.\n\nDollar index failed to extend rally, but more upside still mildly in favor\n\nDollar\u2019s development was rather disappointing, as it reacted more to strong risk-on sentiments much more than the solid NFP report. It\u2019s still too early to call an end to the rise from 89.53 as long as 91.51 support holds. Further rally would still be seen to 93.43 resistance and possibly above.\n\nBut we\u2019d maintain that rise from 89.53 is seen as the third leg of the consolidation pattern from 89.20. Hence, we\u2019d expect strong resistance from 38.2% retracement of 102.99 to 89.20 at 94.46 at 94.46. to limit upside, at least to extend sideway trading. Break of 91.51 will suggest that such rise has completed prematurely, and bring retest of 89.20/53 support zone.\n\nEUR/CHF and EUR/CAD turn weaker, more downside ahead\n\nEuro turned notably weaker in some crosses last week. In particular, EUR/CHF\u2019s break of 1.0939 support argues that rebound from 1.0863 has completed at 1.0985 already. It\u2019s also kept below medium term channel resistance, and struggled to sustain above 55 day EMA. The development argues that choppy decline from 1.1149 is still in progress.\n\nDeeper fall is not in favor for the near term to retest 1.0863 support first. Break will resume the fall from 1.1149 to cluster support level at 1.0737, 61.8% retracement of 1.0505 to 1.1149 at 1.0751.\n\nEUR/CAD also dropped notably on Friday and deeper fall is now in favor this week to retest 1.4580 support. The failure to sustain above falling 55 day EMA keeps near term outlook bearish. Break of 1.14580 will confirm resumption of larger decline from 1.5978 and target 61.8% projection of 1.5783 to 1.4723 from 1.5191 at 1.4536. Firm break there could bring further downside acceleration to 1.4263 long term support next.\n\nCanadian Dollar has some upside prospect ahead\n\nOn the other hand, Canadian Dollar has the prospect of turning stronger, with help from persistently strong oil price, BoC tapering expectation. But that would be subject to the upcoming employment data this week. Anyway, AUD/CAD\u2019s breach of 0.9258 support argues that larger fall from 0.9991 is resuming. Focus is back on 0.9247 key cluster support level (38.2% retracement of 0.8058 to 0.9991 at 0.9253).\n\nSustained break of 0.9247/53 will bring some downside re-acceleration to 61.8% projection of 0.9757 to 0.9258 from 0.9394 at 0.9086. There is prospect of even deeper fall to 61.8% retracement of 0.8058 to 0.9991 at 0.8796. Strong rebound from current level, followed by break of 0.9394 resistance will suggest short term bottoming, and bring turn the fortune between Aussie and Loonie.\n\nAUD/USD Weekly Outlook\n\nAUD/USD edged lower to 0.7443 last week but quickly recovered again. Initial bias is turned neutral this week first. Another fall could still be seen, and break of 0.7443 will resume the whole corrective pattern from 0.8006. But we\u2019d expect strong support from 100% projection of 0.8006 to 0.7530 from 0.7890 at 0.7414 to bring rebound. On the upside, break of 0.7615 resistance will indicate short term bottoming, on bearish divergence condition in 4 hour MACD. Intraday bias will be turned back to the upside for 0.7890/8006 resistance zone.\n\nIn the bigger picture, rise from 0.5506 medium term bottom could either be the start of a long term up trend, or a corrective rise. Reactions to 0.8135 key resistance will reveal which case it is. Rejection by 0.8135 key resistance, followed by firm break of 0.7413 resistance turned support, will favors the latter case. Deeper decline would be seen to 38.2% retracement of 0.5506 to 0.8006 at 0.7051 first.\n\nIn the longer term picture, 0.5506 is a long term bottom, on bullish convergence condition in monthly MACD. Focus is now back on 0.8135 structural resistance. Decisive break there will raise the chance that rise from 0.5506 is an impulsive up trend. Next target should be 61.8% retracement at 0.8950 of 1.1079 to 0.5506 and above. Though, rejection by 0.8135 will keep the case of medium to long term sideway consolidation open."}, {"headline": "AUD/CAD May Be a Catch-Up Trade in Q3: Q3 Top Trading Opportunities", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "DailyFX", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://a.c-dn.net/b/0TRbKm/headline_Generic_1.jpg", "author": ["Justin Mcqueen"], "body": "Coming in to Q2 my trade of short AUD/CAD had been predicated on US exceptionalism and the growing divergence between the BoC and RBA. While the US exceptionalism narrative dissipated, the theme of diverging monetary policy continues to bear watching. The divergence emerged was after the BoC tapered QE, while also signalling a rate increase for H2 2022. In contrast RBA signalled no rate increase before 2024. In Q3 AUD/CAD may be a catch up trade with BoC tightening priced into the currency, while strong Aussie data (employment in particular) may see the RBA to bring forward rate hike expectations.\n\nMeanwhile my view is that USD will head higher from current levels. The consensus trade for arguably the past year has been to short the USD as evidenced by CFTC data showing the build-up in net short positions. However, the FOMC\u2019s hawkish pivot in which the dot plot projections now see two rate hikes in 2023 from zero, suggests that the central bank\u2019s reaction function has changed with FOMC less willing to allow the economy to run hot. Under these conditions, economic data will matter more and spur heightened volatility on data releases.\n\nOn the monetary policy front, the main dates to focus are the Jackson Hole Symposium (marks one year since the launch of AIT) and the September monetary policy meeting. Given the sizeable net short USD positioning, an unwind can provide fuel for a more prolonged rise as we head towards a Q3 taper signal. To add to this, an increase in \u201cdemise of the dollar\u201d reporting late in Q2 coincided with the greenback\u2019s low point, which could suggest that the pain trade would be for a more persistent rise in the USD.\n\nUSD Chart: Daily Time Frame"}, {"headline": "Asian Open: The US Dollar Sits Tall Ahead of Nonfarm Payrolls", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "City Index", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://www.cityindex.co.uk/~/media/research/global/news-analysis/featured-image/jobs-2.jpg", "author": ["Stonex Financial Ltd", "Matt Simpson"], "body": "Asian Futures:\n\nAustralia's ASX 200 futures flat (0%), the cash market is currently estimated to open at 7,265.60\n\nJapan's Nikkei 225 futures are up 120 points (0.42%), the cash market is currently estimated to open at 28,827.04\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng futures are up 18 points (0.06%), the cash market is currently estimated to open at 28,845.95\n\nUK and Europe:\n\nUK's FTSE 100 index rose 87.69 points (1.25%) to close at 7,125.16\n\nEurope's Euro STOXX 50 index rose 14.59 points (0.36%) to close at 4,078.89\n\nGermany's DAX index rose 72.77 points (0.47%) to close at 15,603.81\n\nFrance's CAC 40 index rose 45.99 points (0.71%) to close at 6,553.82\n\nThursday US Close:\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial rose 131.02 points (0.38%) to close at 34,633.53\n\nThe S&P 500 index rose 22.44 points (0.53%) to close at 4,319.94\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 index rose 5.252 points (0.04%) to close at 14,560.05\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn how to trade indices\n\n\n\n\n\nIndices: S&P hits record high for 6th straight day\n\nAnother day, another set of strong employment data and record highs for the US stock market.

But, taken alongside strong ADP beating expectations earlier this week (even if softer than the prior read), it\u2019s not a bad set of data overall ahead of today\u2019s NFP report. But, as Matt Weller points out, some leading indicators point towards a weaker-than expected NFP today which could lead to another disappointment for the highly anticipated release (and take the wind out of sentiment just before the weekend).\n\nThe S&P 500 hit a record high for a sixth consecutive session and rose 0.5%, led by energy, utility and financial sectors. Consumer staples was the only sector to close in the red. Nasdaq biotech stocks rose 1.16%, banking stocks were up 1.06% although the Nasdaq 100 was only up by 0.04%. FAANGS were down slightly at -0.05%.\n\n\n\n\n\nASX 200 Market Internals:\n\n\n\n\n\nASX 200: 7265.6 (-0.65%), 30 July 2021\n\nMaterials (0.08%) was the strongest sector and Consumer Discretionary (-1.3%) was the weakest\n\n9 out of the 11 sectors closed lower\n\n59 (29.65%) stocks advanced, 134 (67.34%) stocks declined\n\n9 hit a new 52-week high, 2 hit a new 52-week low\n\n71.36% of stocks closed above their 200-day average\n\n60.3% of stocks closed above their 50-day average\n\n46.23% of stocks closed above their 20-day average\n\nOutperformers:\n\n+ 8.05% - Regis Resources Ltd (RRL.AX)\n\n+ 5.57% - St Barbara Ltd (SBM.AX)\n\n+ 5.43% - Nuix Ltd (NXL.AX)\n\nUnderperformers:\n\n-5.93% - Chalice Mining Ltd (CHN.AX)\n\n-4.92% - Iluka Resources Ltd (ILU.AX)\n\n-4.51% - Metcash Ltd (MTS.AX)\n\n\n\n\n\nForex: USD retains extends its lead, BOE Bailey send GBP lower\n\nThe US dollar index (DXY) rose to a three-month high of 92.630 overnight as economic data hinted towards a strong NFP print, in turn bring expectations of a hike sooner than the Fed are currently making out. Let\u2019s hope NFP excels to live up to bullish expectation, or else gains be quickly lost.\n\nUSD/JPY reached our first target in the European session and second target in the US and is now trading slightly lower around 111.50. Its next major resistance levels to conquer are the pandemic and highs at 111.71 and 112.22 (with 112.00 thrown in due to being a round number, of course). If today\u2019s NFP data comes in strong enough it could reach 112.0 quite easily and possibly even 12.22. But, if it disappoints once again, we\u2019d expect prices to close firmly beneath the March 2020 high of 111.70 this week and roll over. Therefore, the March 2020 high is a pivotal level around today\u2019s FP report in our view.\n\nThe British pound was the weakest currency BOE\u2019s governor Andrew Bailey after saying it was important to not overact (ie. raise rates) to rising inflation. GBP/USD broken beneath key support of 1.3784 to an 11-week low and EUR/GBP rose 0.43% to print a bearish outside candle. Incidentally, GBP/USD was the weakest pair and EUR/GBP was the strongest.\n\nAUD/USD fell to its lowest level this year before finding support at the December 1st low It very much remains in the hands of today\u2019s NFP report. AUD/CAD warrants a look as it has formed a bullish hammer at the June low (and just above its October low). Granted, its not the prettiest of trades but there is potential for a counter-trend bounce, particularly if Canada\u2019s PMI data, building permits and trade balance data disappoints at 1:30pm tonight.\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn how to trade forex\n\n\n\n\n\nCommodities: OPEC+ send oil prices higher\n\nGold prices rallied for a second day and rose around 0.3%, which is not bad given the strength of the US dollar. We had tipped out hat to gold\u2019s potential to rise yesterday although it didn\u2019t quite reach our lower target of 1785. Still, with real-rates (represented by TIPS) continuing to fall, perhaps there\u2019s till room for gold to rise from here.\n\nThe OPEC+ meeting sent oil prices higher after indicating they would increase production at a slower rate than expected. WTI rose 2.4% to 75.23 and brent rallied 0.53% to settle at 75.53.\n\n\n\n\n\nUp Next (Times in AEST)\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can view all the scheduled events for today using our economic calendar, and keep up to date with the latest market news and analysis here.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to trade with City Index\n\nFollow these easy steps to start trading with City Index today:"}, {"headline": "Top 10 Online Forex Brokers in 2021", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Economy Watch", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://www.economywatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/eToro-3-1024x598.png", "author": [], "body": "If you are interested in forex trading and want to make a career out of it, the first thing you need to do is look for a reputable and reliable broker.

In the course of buying and selling cryptocurrencies, a forex broker is typically a financial service company that acts as an intermediary between the trader and the interbank system. While making a transaction between a pair of currencies that are generally made of the ten most traded and liquid currencies including USD, EUR, AUD, and others, traders can initiate and execute a trade using a forex broker and earn profit depending on the current exchange rate.\n\nHow Do Forex Brokers Work?\n\nThe forex broker typically works as an intermediary between you and the interbank system, which is a network of banks that trade with each other daily. The broker will typically offer you a price from the banks and financial institutions through which they have access to forex liquidity.\n\nWhen you start trading with a forex broker and open your first trade, the broker will pass it through the market. They offer you a price for that particular forex pair, typically shown in quote form such as GBP/USD 1.3500/1.3505. Here, the first number is the rate the broker offers you if you want to sell the pair. The second number shows the rate at which you can buy the pair. The difference between the numbers i.e., .0005 or 5 pips is taken as a commission by the broker and is known as the spread.\n\nA broker will typically provide you with a trading platform, which is a software program that can either be downloaded or used via a browser on the web. This is the main platform where you buy and sell currencies, monitor trades, conduct technical analysis, and all related functions of trading. Once the broker executes your order, it can either be a winning or a losing trade, leading to a profit or loss for your trading account.\n\nBest UK Forex Brokers \u2013 Top 10 Reviewed\n\n1. eToro \u2013 Best of the Best Forex Brokers\n\nFounded in 2007, eToro is one of the leading forex brokers worldwide.

The broker should be regulated by a major international regulatory body.\n\nDo\u2019s and Don\u2019t\u2019s\n\nPicking the right forex broker will certainly nudge you in the right direction. However, success in the forex market also depends on your actions. You should thus know what to do and what not to do to minimise losses and maximise profits.\n\nDo:\n\nDevelop a concrete plan: You should always try to develop a concrete plan before you dive into the market. Evaluate your goals and objectives before you cast your first trade. Entering the market without a plan can have disastrous consequences, especially if one trades impulsively.\n\nAlways use stop loss and take profit: It\u2019s always important to sit down and evaluate the amount of profit that you feel is realistically achievable. This extends to the use of stop-loss and take-profit levels. Failure to choose fixed levels for closing your trading position will result in closing trades based on emotion.\n\nResearching the market: Staying on top of the factors that affect the forex market. This can extend to international politics, news regarding financial regulations, and other factors such as wars and natural disasters. Typically you would want to get real-time information on factors that affect the currency pair you\u2019re trading, such as the country\u2019s inflation rates and other economic markers.\n\nDon\u2019t:\n\nDon\u2019t commit money you can\u2019t afford to lose: There is a fine line between trading cautiously and outright gambling. So you should always stay within the budget parameters set. It is very easy to get carried away and end up investing more money than you originally planned in forex trading.\n\nDon\u2019t commit revenge trading: Revenge trading is when you try to make up for losses incurred earlier in the day by impulsively executing trades. Do not fall for this trap as you will end up trading using raw emotion rather than trading rules, leading to more losses. You should rather use take-profit levels to lock your gains once you reach your profit target levels. This will alleviate the temptation for further gains.\n\nDon\u2019t let emotions take over: Human emotions such as greed and fear can lead to impractical trading decisions where you will end up incurring a loss. For instance, fear can lead to traders closing their positions early missing out on profits. Always remember that you should stick to your set plan and exit the market once your target profit level for the day has been achieved.\n\nHow to Begin Trading With Forex Brokers \u2013 eToro Guide\n\n\n\nOnce you have made up your mind about which forex broker to use for trading your preferred forex pairs then all that is left to do is start trading.

Furthermore, consumer\u2019s outlook on whether jobs are \u2018plentiful\u2019 over \u2018hard to get\u2019 rose to its highest differential since 2000, which could bode well for Friday\u2019s NFP report if that indeed turns out to be the current situation.\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 extended their record highs, with the S&P 500 extending its record for a fourth consecutive session. Yet volatility was low overall with the S&P and Dow Jones rising just 0.3% and the Nasdaq rose 0.33%.\n\nIn Europe equities had a positive start yet failed to hold onto early gains to close effectively flat. The FTSE 100 and CAC printed bearish hammers inside Monday\u2019s bearish ranges, so we are still on guard for a bearish break on the FTSE of Monday\u2019s low.\n\nThe ASX 200 threw a spanner in the works of the symmetrical triangle discussed yesterday, by teasing bears with a downside break yet recovering later in the session to close flat with a bullish pinbar. Considering this is as 10 million Australian\u2019s went into lockdown then it\u2019s not a bad close at all.

Commodity currencies were the weakest majors overnight and the weakest month-to-date.\n\nThe Japanese yen was the strongest major as the risk-off sentiment apparent in yesterday\u2019s Asian session spilled over to the European and US ones. The yen was up against all its major peers but made the most ground against the Australian dollar as several states have headed back into lockdown and the Delta variant rose across parts of Asia. AUD/JPY was the biggest mover, shedding -0.8% in line with our bearish bias and its ranges topping near its 10-day ATR and hitting the initial target of 0.8300. Its next support level is 82.76. Strong economic sentiment for Europe lifted EUR/AUD to our near-term bullish target at its 200-day eMA.\n\nThe US dollar index (DXY) moved higher in line with its double bottom breakout, rose to a six-day high and made it around \u00be of its way to the double bottom target at 92.30. USD/CHF stopped just shy of our June high target and GBP/USD came just 14 pips from our initial 1.3800 target. AUD/USD and NZD/USD both closed firmly beneath their 200-day eMA\u2019s after printing prominent highs.\n\n\n\n\n\nUSD/JPY was just -0.1% lower by the close but intraday price action suggests the move to be corrective. Its trend remains bullish overall, and prices are accelerating away from trendline support to show a pickup of momentum. Prices have also retraced for four consecutive days since last week\u2019s high. Moreover, prices have formed a Doji and respected a cluster of support including the monthly R1 and pivot and weekly pivot point and 20-day eMA. Therefore, if prices can break above yesterday\u2019s high without breaking the support zone then bulls could assume momentum is trying to realign with its bullish trend.\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn how to trade forex\n\n\n\n\n\nCommodities: Metals feel the weight of a stronger dollar\n\nGold and silver finally woke up from their small but choppy sideways ranges with downside breaks.

Silver fell -1.26% and probed the 25.56 low before closing at 25.73.\n\nPlatinum futures fell -3% and accelerated further away from its 200-day eMA after printing a two-bar bearish reversal at the technical milestone on Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUp Next (Times in AEST)\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can view all the scheduled events for today using our economic calendar, and keep up to date with the latest market news and analysis here."}, {"headline": "Exchange rates predict exchange rates: GBP/USD, USD/CAD, EUR/JPY", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "FXStreet", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://editorial.fxstreet.com/images/Markets/Currencies/Majors/GBPUSD/iStock-1088749732_Large.jpg", "author": [], "body": "GBP/USD Vs USD/CAD contained nearly a 2000 pip spread and nonnormal.

Trading conditions will be thin with liquidity at a premium. The release of the US Payrolls report on Friday is huge in the light of recent US inflation data (CPI, PCE). All forecasts from ACY\u2019s Finlogix, unless specified. Today kicks off with Japan\u2019s May Unemployment Rate (Finlogix forecast: 2.9% from 2.8 % m/m). Japan\u2019s May Job Application Ratio (monthly job openings) follows next (f/c 1.08 from previous 1.09). Japan also reports on its May Retail Sales (y/y forecast 7.9% from previous 12%). Europe starts off with France\u2019s Q1 Unemployment Rate (Q4 2020 was 8%, no forecasts given). French Consumer Confidence for June follows (f/c 100 from previous 97). UK reports on its June Nationwide House Prices (m/m f/c 0.7% from 1.8%, y/y f/c 13.7% from 10.9%). UK Net Lending to Individuals for May follows (m/m f/c GBP 4.6 billion from GBP 2.9 billion). UK May Mortgage Approvals follow (f/c 85.34k from 86.9k). Eurozone Consumer Confidence for June follows (f/c -3.3 from -5.1). Germany releases its June Preliminary Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (y/y f/c 2.1% from 2.4%). The US rounds up today\u2019s reports with its April House Price Index (m/m f/c 1.4% from 1.5% - Forex Factory). Finally, US April S&P Case Shiller Home Price Index (y/y f/c 14.5% from 13.3%) is released. ECB President Christine Lagarde is due to speak at a Brussels Economic Forum. US FOMC member Thomas Barkin (President \u2013 Richmond Fed) speaks in a webinar hosted by Market News International.\n\nTrading Perspective: As we approach the month and quarter end, and into Friday\u2019s US Payrolls report, we can expect liquidity to dry up with conditions thin. Currency moves will be dictated by supply/demand factors heading in the June quarter finish. That said, tonight\u2019s German and Eurozone Inflation data are important. Wages will be the focus on the US Jobs report released this Friday. While the US Dollar maintains an edge against its rivals (due to the recent inflation spike), the fall in US bond yields, not matched entirely by drops in other yields bears watching. Speculative market positioning will also play its part. The latest Commitment of Traders/CFTC report (week ended 22 June) which followed the hawkish Fed FOMC meeting outcome saw a large reduction of USD short bets against the Euro, Sterling, and Japanese Yen. Net long Euro bets were reduced to a 7-week low. Aussie short bets though increased to -AUD 17,575 contracts, which is just about 100% of its yearly high.\n\nAUD/USD \u2013 while the Aussie continues its grind lower, net short speculative market positioning will limit further downside. Downside pressure on the AUD/USD pair is still strong. The western city of Perth entered a 4-day lockdown after a third Covid-19 case was recorded. AUD/USD has immediate support at 0.7550 (overnight low 0.75544) followed by 0.7530 and 0.7500. Immediate resistance can be found at 0.7580 and 0.7600.

EUR/USD correlations to AUD/CAD run +39% and +87% to AUD/USD. EUR/USD correlations to NZD/USD run +93%.\n\nGBP/USD Vs AUD/NZD correlations run +67% and +37% to AUD/USD. GBP/USD to NZD/USD correlations run +21%. Not good to exchange rate relationships.\n\nOverall exchange rate relationships are simplified by a $4 calculator and as the most vitally important tool, a trader must possess in the trading arsenal. Understanding is half the battle to winning. A vast majority of traders today employ charts, faulty indicators, wrong positioned moving averages, and apply it to an incorrect currency and/or market price. The currency and market price is never correct so the system is set up for failure."}, {"headline": "The Powell testimony is likely to control sentiment", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "FXStreet", "date": "2 weeks ago", "image": "https://editorial.fxstreet.com/images/Macroeconomics/CentralBanks/FED/Jerome Powell 1Fed__Large.jpg", "author": [], "body": "Outlook: The big data release is existing home sales today and new home sales tomorrow. These are not market-movers in FX, although the press is warning that once again, big investment houses are picking up houses to rent out. This smells bad, mostly because giant corporations make lousy landlords, as we saw in the great housing disruption following 2008-09. This time it\u2019s not the cheap foreclosures they are after, but an expectation of endlessly higher housing prices that will allow endlessly higher rents. It won\u2019t be long before we get some critical academic treatment of the role of rents and rentiers. It\u2019s not pretty. Gittler at BDSwiss has a cute description\u2014\u201cThe US housing market has gone full Bitcoin.\u201d He cites one nugget\u2014housing prices in Phoenix AZ are up over 10% in just the last 30 days.\n\nThe Powell testimony today is likely to control sentiment. Technically he is speaking to the House Select Subcommittee on the Covid Crisis. His opening remarks have already been released and according to those who have seen them, he repeats the comments from the last FOMC. The only issue is whether any House members ask questions he could fumble. But Powell is a competent guy and tends not to fumble nor to obfuscate. Powell will stay true to form and downplay both inflation and the scary idea of accelerated tapering/hikes. The WSJ has his back today, too, with a well-illustrated article on how inflation fades when the base effect is removed by looking at current data vs. pre-pandemic data.\n\nThe quest worldwide to fix fragile and frayed supply chains is a big deal. Various countries, including the US and Japan, plan to invest heavily in chip production, for example. But China still has a largely controlling role. The FT reports a Covid outbreak in a shipping port last month forced a lockdown and that, together with surging new demand, has led to gigantic increases in shipping costs. See the chart. \u201c\u2026 the cost of sending a 40-ft container on Asia to North Europe route recently topped $11,000 for the first time, up from about $8,500 in mid-May and $2,000 last October, according to Freightos.\u201d\n\nShipping costs are, of course, a contributor to overall inflation, but is likely to be one of those inflexible that gets fixed fast. Shipping logistics experts are scrambling to reroute ships and one says we will get back to pre-Covid supply chain reliability in 6 to 9 months.\n\nThe problem facing economists and chartists alik this morning is how to predict the response to a less-hawkish Fed. We still have two important regional Feds, Dallas Kaplan, and St. Louis Bullard, promoting the idea of accelerated tapering/hikes. The rules of Fed management specifically call for each regional and Board Fed to be allowed to speak his own mind, the only exception being the period immediately preceding an Open Market Committee meeting. In other words, Powell does not have the ability to rein in maverick Feds, even if he wanted to.\n\nThe implication for the dollar is that its meteoric rise is ending. But a stop-and-reverse move like we just had in the euro is vanishingly rare. We complain that breaking norms like the Bollinger bands and standard error channel leaves us without guidance, but at the same time, we can\u2019t expect prices to fall back into their old channels as though the breakouts were just dismissible aberrations. They are not dismissible. Most breakouts are, indeed, false, meaning they fade away and the previous move reasserts itself. But not when the breakout is as big as this. It\u2019s a judgment, but we\u2019d say this is not a false breakout\u2014but we won\u2019t know for some time and certainly not today and maybe not this week.\n\nIf the breakout is real, we expect the euro to resume its down move, and then we are looking for a test of the previous low, 1.1722 from March 30\u2014despite being oversold. We had something similar in Jan-Feb. Other currencies are trickier, especially sterling and the AUD/CAD. The BoE is expected to say dovish on the grounds the extension of the lockdown calls for prudence, but you never know. As for the AUD and CAD, they are expected to be leaders in exiting extreme QE. Why would they not benefit from rising rates?\n\nOne nagging worry\u2014the delta variants get a grip in the US and we get another wave of Covid. There is no appetite for a lockdown anywhere, let alone the states where low vaccination rates prevail. This cuts into recovery and raises the risk of prolonging ultra-easy conditions. Do we get risk-off and dollar buying as a result, or risk-off and get out of dollars because the growth/reflation trajectory is damaged? Nobody knows the answer to that one.\n\nThis is an excerpt from \u201cThe Rockefeller Morning Briefing,\u201d which is far larger (about 10 pages).

Download our new 3Q top trading opportunities guide from the DailyFX Free Trading Guides!\n\nThe Australian Dollar topped against the US Dollar in the first quarter and continued its slow and steady descent in the following three months. The third quarter could look similar, with AUD/USD struggling. That is because it might be weighed down by a combination of a less-dovish Federal Reserve and ongoing developments in China that pose a risk to the currency\u2019s trajectory.\n\nIn the US, the Fed is becoming less dovish. June\u2019s monetary policy announcement showed a consensus for two rate hikes by the end of 2023, perhaps. This also likely implies that a tapering of its balance sheet could come sooner than anticipated. Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of Australia reported that the cash rate may not increase until 2024 at the earliest.\n\nAs such, the yield advantage may go to the US Dollar in the long run as market sentiment momentum likely struggles to achieve the same breakneck pace set throughout most of last year. This is something that the growth-linked Australian Dollar could use to rekindle its upward momentum, and remains an upside factor for AUD/USD.\n\nHowever in China, Australia\u2019s largest trading partner, the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) has already been normalizing monetary policy to a certain extent. The central bank has been draining liquidity for most of this year via open market operations. This is as corporate bond issuance shrunk by the most since 2017 in May.\n\nChina\u2019s government is trying to tackle exuberance in financial markets, expressing concerns over market bubbles and speculation in commodities. The nation is working to release metal reserves in an effort to tame soaring prices, such as what has been seen in copper. Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions between China and Australia are brewing.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Covid-19 breakout, Australia called for an investigation (along with other international communities) into China\u2019s handling of the coronavirus. The latter responded by imposing tariffs on certain Australian products. China also sued Australia over anti-dumping measures at the World Trade Organization towards the end of June.\n\nA combination of a less-dovish Fed, the PBOC\u2019s normalization and deteriorating Sino-Australian tensions risks boding ill for the Aussie Dollar during the third quarter. Due to close trading relationships, economic developments in China often produce a knock-on impact for Australia. Given the sentiment-linked nature of the Aussie Dollar, this does not seem to bode well.\n\nOn the chart below, a custom majors-based Australian Dollar index can be seen aiming lower with the CSI 300 and copper prices. The index averages AUD against USD, EUR, GBP and JPY. Moreover, the momentum between the 3 data series that was seen after March 2020 has been noticeably slowing. More of the same could be ahead.\n\nSee the favorite trades from each DailyFX Analyst for the third quarter.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) highlights a similar dynamic as the indicator establishes a downward trend and sits at its lowest reading in over a year, and it remains to be seen if the decline from February high (0.8007) will turn out to be a correction in the broader trend or a key reversal in market behavior amid the diverging paths between the Fed and RBA.\n\nWith that said, failure to hold above the 50-Week SMA (0.7485) may push AUD/USD towards the former resistance zone around0.7370 (38.2% expansion) to 0.7390 (38.2% expansion), with the next area of interest coming in around 0.7090 (78.6% retracement) to 0.7180 (61.8% retracement).\n\nAUD/JPY Weekly Chart\n\nSource: Trading View\n\nAUD/JPY has outperformed its US counterpart as it climbed to a fresh yearly high (85.80) in May, and the exchange rate may continue to exhibit the bullish price action from earlier this year as it holds above the March low (82.09).\n\nHowever, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) appears to have diverged with price as it failed to push into overbought territory in May, and the oscillator may continue to show the bullish momentum abating as it snaps the upward trend carried over from the previous year.\n\nWith that said, AUD/JPY may face a correction over the coming months as the V-shape recovery from 2020 stalls ahead of the Fibonacci overlap around 86.10 (38.2% retracement) to 86.30 (78.6% expansion), with a close below the 82.40 (50% expansion) region on a weekly timeframe bringing the 79.50 (161.8% expansion) to 80.20 (38.2% expansion) area on the radar.\n\n--- Written by David Song, Currency Strategist\n\nFollow me on Twitter at @DavidJSong"}, {"headline": "The Australian stock market closed higher; S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.59% from Investing.com", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "QNT", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXNPEC4S0H2_L.jpg", "author": ["Agnes Zang", "About The Author"], "body": "\u00a9 Reuters.

Sustained break there will carry larger bullish implication. Next target is 61.8% projection of 102.58 to 110.95 from 107.47 at 112.64. On the downside, break of 110.41 support is needed to indicate short term topping. Otherwise, outlook will stay bullish in case of retreat.\n\nIn the bigger picture, medium term outlook is staying neutral with 111.71 resistance intact. Though, as notable support was seen from 55 day EMA, rise from 102.58 is mildly in favor to extend higher. Decisive break of 111.71/112.22 resistance will suggest medium term bullish reversal. Rise from 101.18 could then target 118.65 resistance (Dec 2016) and above. However, sustained break of 55 day EMA would revive some medium term bearishness, and open up deep fall to 61.8% retracement of 102.58 to 110.95 at 105.77 and below.\n\nEconomic Indicators Update"}, {"headline": "Patterns: AUD/JPY, CAD/JPY", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "FXStreet", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://editorial.fxstreet.com/images/Markets/Currencies/Crosses/AUDJPY/forex-australia-and-japanese-currency-pair-with-calculator-4780678_Large.jpg", "author": [], "body": "AUD/JPY 4H Chart: Could target 82.00\n\nThe Australian Dollar has declined by 1.68% against the Japanese Yen since June 25.

With today being the last trading day of the month, quarter and half-year, technical factors will dominate.\n\nChinese PMI data will be the focus this morning in Asia as well as the continuing Covid-19 conditions in Australia and other Asian nations (Indonesia, Thailand).

GBP/USD and EUR/JPY traded higher while USD/CAD traded lower in a 3-way triangulation trade as 3 trades existed.\n\nThe perfect scenario at 91's is the result of correlations between GBP/USD and USD/CAD at -97%. GBP/USD and USD/CAD's relationship defines currency markets due not only to USD Vs Non-USD but many currency pairs factor against this relationship.\n\nFor example, GBP/USD minus USD/CHF equates to CHF/JPY, and USD/CAD minus USD/CHF equals EUR/CHF and AUD/NZD. By trading exchange rates by exchange rates by use of a calculator, found is a support or resistance point or entry and target.\n\nEUR/JPY is clearly the leader to JPY cross pairs as known from most widely traded currency in 3 years Triennial Surveys dating to 2001. Why is due from many ways to factor exchange rates to lead to EUR/JPY. GBP/JPY minus USD/JPY will also lead to EUR/JPY. GBP/CHF minus USD/CAD reveals a massive EUR/JPY bottom at 125.00's.\n\nThe question to the 3 way Triangulation trades was GBP/USD at its top, USD/CAD at bottoms, or EUR/JPY at its top. The answer reveals 3 trades and each trades for 200 pips each.\n\nMany ways by exchange rates factor to exchange rates will lead to GBP/CAD, EUR/CAD, AUD/CAD, and NZD/CAD due to GBP/CAD and EUR/CAD as middle currency pairs to the EUR and GBP universe. AUD/CAD and NZD/CAD reveal tops and bottoms to NZD and AUD currencies.\n\nCHF/JPY minus USD/JPY reveals CHF/JPY's target at 115.00's yet this 115.00 target is validated by the MA system.\n\nMore examples to exchange rates by exchange rates\n\nGBP/NZD minus EUR/NZD = GBP/AUD.\n\nEUR/USD minus NZD/CHF = USD/CHF.\n\nUSD/JPY + USD/CHF = EUR/CAD.\n\nGBP/CAD minus EUR/NZD = GBP/CAD.\n\nGBP/NZD minus GBP/CAD = GBP/AUD.\n\nEUR/AUD minus EUR/CAD = GBP/JPY.\n\nGBP/JPY minus USD/JPY = EUR/JPY.\n\nGBP/CAD minus USD/CAD = EUR/CAD.\n\nAUD/NZD minus AUD/USD = AUD/CAD.\n\nAUD/CAD minus AUD/USD = NZD/CAD.\n\nEUR/NZD minus EUR/CAD = EUR/AUD.\n\nUSD/CAD minus CAD/JPY = EUR/CHF.\n\nExchange rates trade far more closer to each other than what is reveled by the eyeball. EUR/CHF for example trades 1.0900 Vs AUD/NZD 1.0756 and a cross-over point at 1.0858."}]}, {"id": "AUD/USD", "price_data": [0.7657436728477478, 0.7656616568565369, 0.7656030058860779,

However, it closed the week with gains against most of its major rivals. The monthly employment report showed that the US added 860,000 new jobs in June, but also that the unemployment rate ticked higher to 5.9%. The greenback surged right after the release, but gave up ahead of the close, as stocks soared.\n\nWall Street posted solid gains, with the S&P closing at record levels for a seventh consecutive day. Government bond yields, on the other hand eased with that on the 10-year US Treasury note settling at 1.43%.\n\nHigh-yielding currencies recovered alongside equities, but their bullish potential is limited. The EUR/USD pair trades at 1.1860, while GBP/USD hovers around 1.3830. The AUD/USD pair recovered from a fresh 2021 low of 0.7444 and settled a handful of pips above 0.7500. The Canadian dollar was among the strongest USD rivals as crude oil prices soared.\n\nOPEC+ talks were delayed last week after members were unable to reach an agreement. The United Arab Emirates want a greater share of output. The UAE said a production extension is conditional to revising its baseline production. Talks will resume on Monday.\n\nGold advanced within range, with the bright metal ending the week at $1,787 a troy ounce.\n\nThe US celebrates a holiday on Monday, which means reduced markets\u2019 activity.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction: BTC locks in on $40,000"}, {"headline": "AUD/USD Forecast: Possible bullish extension toward 0.7600", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "FXStreet", "date": "41 mins ago", "image": "https://editorial.fxstreet.com/images/Markets/Currencies/Majors/AUDUSD/stack-of-australian-dollar-29363314_Large.jpg", "author": [], "body": "The AUD/USD pair is technically bearish, according to the daily chart. The pair is developing below all of its moving averages, with the 20 SMA heading firmly lower between the longer ones. Technical indicators have bounced from oversold readings but remain well below their midlines. In the near-term, and according to the 4-hour chart, the advance may extend as the pair has moved well above its 20 SMA, which is currently flat, while technical indicators maintain their bullish slopes within positive levels. The longer moving averages, however, head firmly lower above the current price, limiting the upside.\n\nAustralia published housing-related data on Friday, which came in mixed. Home Loans contracted in May from 4.3% to 1.9%, while Investment Lending for Homes increased from 2.1% to 13.3%. The country will publish on Monday the June AIG Performance of Construction Index, the Commonwealth Bank Services PMI for the same month, and the final version of May Retail Sales , expected to be confirmed at 0.1%.\n\nThe AUD/USD pair recovered on Friday to close the week in the red in the 0.7520 price zone. Before recovering, however, the pair set a fresh 2021 low of 0.7444. The aussie suffered from the latest coronavirus-related headlines coming from the country, as several new cases have forced local governments to impose lockdowns. The immunization campaign in the country is going slow, as only 4% of the population is fully vaccinated. Meanwhile, the greenback benefited from solid employment figures, easing ahead of the close on profit-taking coupled with risk-appetite.\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

The AUD/USD pair fell below the 0.7500 psychological mark and tested 21 December lows of 0.7445 area. The downtrend stemmed from Fed Chair Powel\u2019s comments last week that triggered a rally in Greenback across the board. However, a nonfarm payroll report for the US came out and turned the upside-down of the market. Although the pair closed in red, it was able to catch some bids at the end of the session.\n\nAUD/USD on NFP\n\nThe employers were able to add 850k new jobs in the US economy, which has been the strongest figure since August 2020. The momentum has clearly picked over the past two months.\n\nDespite a sharp rise in payrolls, the unemployment rate rose to 5.9%. The rise emerged from household measures of employment that dropped to 18k. Thus, although the labor supply increased, the reduction in unemployment will take more time.\n\nThe AUD/USD pair picked up bids from 8-month lows amid little discouraging figures of unemployment. The upbeat jobs addition could not help the Greenback rally to continue. The pair has pared off some of the weekly losses.\n\nWhat to watch next week?\n\nThe RBA meeting next week can also be decisive for the pair to find the directional bias. It should be noted here that on Monday, July 5, American trading floors will be closed. The States will continue to celebrate the public holiday (Independence Day). Literally the next day, during the Asian session on Tuesday, the RBA will announce its verdict on the prospects for monetary policy. For AUD/USD traders, this means that the pair may show increased volatility in the near future.\n\nOn the other hand, the US ISM survey and Fed meeting minutes are also important events next week that can provide fresh impetus to the market.\n\nAUD/USD technical weekly forecast: Are bulls too dominating?\n\nThe bullish bar on the daily chart shows signs of bottom reversal with healthy volume. However, immediately, it is capped by 200-day SMA ahead of congestion of 20 and 50 DMAs.\n\nBulls need to clear the resistance of 0.7550 and sustain above the level to retain the bullish traction. Furthermore, local high and 20-day SMA at 0.7600 area can serve as another resistance level. However, we can see a mild corrective retracement of Friday\u2019s bulls on Monday and Tuesday that can provide fresh buying opportunities.\n\nLooking to trade forex now?

The third quarter could look similar, with AUD/USD struggling. That is because it might be weighed down by a combination of a less-dovish Federal Reserve and ongoing developments in China that pose a risk to the currency\u2019s trajectory.\n\nIn the US, the Fed is becoming less dovish. June\u2019s monetary policy announcement showed a consensus for two rate hikes by the end of 2023, perhaps. This also likely implies that a tapering of its balance sheet could come sooner than anticipated. Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of Australia reported that the cash rate may not increase until 2024 at the earliest.\n\nAs such, the yield advantage may go to the US Dollar in the long run as market sentiment momentum likely struggles to achieve the same breakneck pace set throughout most of last year. This is something that the growth-linked Australian Dollar could use to rekindle its upward momentum, and remains an upside factor for AUD/USD.\n\nHowever in China, Australia\u2019s largest trading partner, the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) has already been normalizing monetary policy to a certain extent. The central bank has been draining liquidity for most of this year via open market operations. This is as corporate bond issuance shrunk by the most since 2017 in May.\n\nChina\u2019s government is trying to tackle exuberance in financial markets, expressing concerns over market bubbles and speculation in commodities. The nation is working to release metal reserves in an effort to tame soaring prices, such as what has been seen in copper. Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions between China and Australia are brewing.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Covid-19 breakout, Australia called for an investigation (along with other international communities) into China\u2019s handling of the coronavirus. The latter responded by imposing tariffs on certain Australian products. China also sued Australia over anti-dumping measures at the World Trade Organization towards the end of June.\n\nA combination of a less-dovish Fed, the PBOC\u2019s normalization and deteriorating Sino-Australian tensions risks boding ill for the Aussie Dollar during the third quarter. Due to close trading relationships, economic developments in China often produce a knock-on impact for Australia. Given the sentiment-linked nature of the Aussie Dollar, this does not seem to bode well.\n\nOn the chart below, a custom majors-based Australian Dollar index can be seen aiming lower with the CSI 300 and copper prices. The index averages AUD against USD, EUR, GBP and JPY. Moreover, the momentum between the 3 data series that was seen after March 2020 has been noticeably slowing. More of the same could be ahead.\n\nSee the favorite trades from each DailyFX Analyst for the third quarter.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) highlights a similar dynamic as the indicator establishes a downward trend and sits at its lowest reading in over a year, and it remains to be seen if the decline from February high (0.8007) will turn out to be a correction in the broader trend or a key reversal in market behavior amid the diverging paths between the Fed and RBA.\n\nWith that said, failure to hold above the 50-Week SMA (0.7485) may push AUD/USD towards the former resistance zone around0.7370 (38.2% expansion) to 0.7390 (38.2% expansion), with the next area of interest coming in around 0.7090 (78.6% retracement) to 0.7180 (61.8% retracement).\n\nAUD/JPY Weekly Chart\n\nSource: Trading View\n\nAUD/JPY has outperformed its US counterpart as it climbed to a fresh yearly high (85.80) in May, and the exchange rate may continue to exhibit the bullish price action from earlier this year as it holds above the March low (82.09).\n\nHowever, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) appears to have diverged with price as it failed to push into overbought territory in May, and the oscillator may continue to show the bullish momentum abating as it snaps the upward trend carried over from the previous year.\n\nWith that said, AUD/JPY may face a correction over the coming months as the V-shape recovery from 2020 stalls ahead of the Fibonacci overlap around 86.10 (38.2% retracement) to 86.30 (78.6% expansion), with a close below the 82.40 (50% expansion) region on a weekly timeframe bringing the 79.50 (161.8% expansion) to 80.20 (38.2% expansion) area on the radar.\n\n--- Written by David Song, Currency Strategist\n\nFollow me on Twitter at @DavidJSong"}, {"headline": "Focus Might Turns to Euro Selling While Dollar Rally Capped by Strong Risk Appetite", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Action Forex", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://www.actionforex.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/f-eur9-e1600272705134.jpg", "author": [], "body": "Dollar ended as the strongest one last week but Friday\u2019s steel fall after solid non-farm payroll job reports suggests that it\u2019s rally is already losing steam. It\u2019s still a bit early to call a bearish reversal for the greenback. Yet, strong risk-on sentiments could cap Dollar\u2019s upside attempts ahead, and even trigger a deeper pull back.\n\nEuro ended as the second weakest, next to Aussie, but the late development in EUR/AUD suggests that the favor is not on Euro\u2019s side. More importantly, developments in some crosses like EUR/CHF and EUR/CAD indicates that market focuses might turn to selling in Euro in crosses ahead. On the other hand, the late rebound in Canadian Dollar opens up some upside prospects for the near term.\n\nNASDAQ closed at new record, heading to 15k handle\n\nNASDAQ\u2019s up trend continued last wee after some hesitation, and finished with a strong close at new record high of 14639.32. Near term outlook will remain bullish as long as 14439.90 supports. Next target is 61.8% projection of 10822.57 to 14175.11 from 13002.53 at 15074.39.\n\nThat would be an important level to overcome as it\u2019s firstly close to 15k handle. More importantly, a strong break of 15k could put weekly MACD back into a rising track. That would in turn argues that NASDAQ is back in medium term up side acceleration. Strong break of 15k would set the stage for even more powerful rise in this 2H of the year.\n\nDOW to catch to resume record run.\n\nDOW also made some notable progress even though it\u2019s still lagging behind S&P 500 and NASDAQ. Current development argues that consolidation pattern from 35091.56 has already completed at 33271.93, after brief breach of medium term channel support.\n\nDOW could take on 35091.56 record high this week, and break will confirm resumption of larger up trend from 18213.65. Next target would be 100% projection of 18213.65 to 2919935 from 26143.77 at 37129.47.\n\nDollar index failed to extend rally, but more upside still mildly in favor\n\nDollar\u2019s development was rather disappointing, as it reacted more to strong risk-on sentiments much more than the solid NFP report. It\u2019s still too early to call an end to the rise from 89.53 as long as 91.51 support holds. Further rally would still be seen to 93.43 resistance and possibly above.\n\nBut we\u2019d maintain that rise from 89.53 is seen as the third leg of the consolidation pattern from 89.20. Hence, we\u2019d expect strong resistance from 38.2% retracement of 102.99 to 89.20 at 94.46 at 94.46. to limit upside, at least to extend sideway trading. Break of 91.51 will suggest that such rise has completed prematurely, and bring retest of 89.20/53 support zone.\n\nEUR/CHF and EUR/CAD turn weaker, more downside ahead\n\nEuro turned notably weaker in some crosses last week. In particular, EUR/CHF\u2019s break of 1.0939 support argues that rebound from 1.0863 has completed at 1.0985 already. It\u2019s also kept below medium term channel resistance, and struggled to sustain above 55 day EMA. The development argues that choppy decline from 1.1149 is still in progress.\n\nDeeper fall is not in favor for the near term to retest 1.0863 support first. Break will resume the fall from 1.1149 to cluster support level at 1.0737, 61.8% retracement of 1.0505 to 1.1149 at 1.0751.\n\nEUR/CAD also dropped notably on Friday and deeper fall is now in favor this week to retest 1.4580 support. The failure to sustain above falling 55 day EMA keeps near term outlook bearish. Break of 1.14580 will confirm resumption of larger decline from 1.5978 and target 61.8% projection of 1.5783 to 1.4723 from 1.5191 at 1.4536. Firm break there could bring further downside acceleration to 1.4263 long term support next.\n\nCanadian Dollar has some upside prospect ahead\n\nOn the other hand, Canadian Dollar has the prospect of turning stronger, with help from persistently strong oil price, BoC tapering expectation. But that would be subject to the upcoming employment data this week. Anyway, AUD/CAD\u2019s breach of 0.9258 support argues that larger fall from 0.9991 is resuming. Focus is back on 0.9247 key cluster support level (38.2% retracement of 0.8058 to 0.9991 at 0.9253).\n\nSustained break of 0.9247/53 will bring some downside re-acceleration to 61.8% projection of 0.9757 to 0.9258 from 0.9394 at 0.9086. There is prospect of even deeper fall to 61.8% retracement of 0.8058 to 0.9991 at 0.8796. Strong rebound from current level, followed by break of 0.9394 resistance will suggest short term bottoming, and bring turn the fortune between Aussie and Loonie.\n\nAUD/USD Weekly Outlook\n\nAUD/USD edged lower to 0.7443 last week but quickly recovered again. Initial bias is turned neutral this week first. Another fall could still be seen, and break of 0.7443 will resume the whole corrective pattern from 0.8006. But we\u2019d expect strong support from 100% projection of 0.8006 to 0.7530 from 0.7890 at 0.7414 to bring rebound. On the upside, break of 0.7615 resistance will indicate short term bottoming, on bearish divergence condition in 4 hour MACD. Intraday bias will be turned back to the upside for 0.7890/8006 resistance zone.\n\nIn the bigger picture, rise from 0.5506 medium term bottom could either be the start of a long term up trend, or a corrective rise. Reactions to 0.8135 key resistance will reveal which case it is. Rejection by 0.8135 key resistance, followed by firm break of 0.7413 resistance turned support, will favors the latter case. Deeper decline would be seen to 38.2% retracement of 0.5506 to 0.8006 at 0.7051 first.\n\nIn the longer term picture, 0.5506 is a long term bottom, on bullish convergence condition in monthly MACD. Focus is now back on 0.8135 structural resistance. Decisive break there will raise the chance that rise from 0.5506 is an impulsive up trend. Next target should be 61.8% retracement at 0.8950 of 1.1079 to 0.5506 and above. Though, rejection by 0.8135 will keep the case of medium to long term sideway consolidation open."}, {"headline": "AUD/CAD May Be a Catch-Up Trade in Q3: Q3 Top Trading Opportunities", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "DailyFX", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://a.c-dn.net/b/0TRbKm/headline_Generic_1.jpg", "author": ["Justin Mcqueen"], "body": "Coming in to Q2 my trade of short AUD/CAD had been predicated on US exceptionalism and the growing divergence between the BoC and RBA. While the US exceptionalism narrative dissipated, the theme of diverging monetary policy continues to bear watching. The divergence emerged was after the BoC tapered QE, while also signalling a rate increase for H2 2022. In contrast RBA signalled no rate increase before 2024. In Q3 AUD/CAD may be a catch up trade with BoC tightening priced into the currency, while strong Aussie data (employment in particular) may see the RBA to bring forward rate hike expectations.\n\nMeanwhile my view is that USD will head higher from current levels. The consensus trade for arguably the past year has been to short the USD as evidenced by CFTC data showing the build-up in net short positions. However, the FOMC\u2019s hawkish pivot in which the dot plot projections now see two rate hikes in 2023 from zero, suggests that the central bank\u2019s reaction function has changed with FOMC less willing to allow the economy to run hot. Under these conditions, economic data will matter more and spur heightened volatility on data releases.\n\nOn the monetary policy front, the main dates to focus are the Jackson Hole Symposium (marks one year since the launch of AIT) and the September monetary policy meeting. Given the sizeable net short USD positioning, an unwind can provide fuel for a more prolonged rise as we head towards a Q3 taper signal. To add to this, an increase in \u201cdemise of the dollar\u201d reporting late in Q2 coincided with the greenback\u2019s low point, which could suggest that the pain trade would be for a more persistent rise in the USD.\n\nUSD Chart: Daily Time Frame"}, {"headline": "AUD Q3 Fundamental Forecast: Australian Dollar Outlook Mired by Dovish RBA Forward Guidance", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "DailyFX", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://a.c-dn.net/b/2UZcwj/headline_shutterstock_215506225.jpg", "author": ["David Song"], "body": "The Australia Dollar faced headwinds throughout the second quarter of 2021 as the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) offered a dovish forward guidance for monetary policy, with AUD/USD trading to a fresh yearly low (0.7477) in June as Federal Reserve officials project two rate hikes for 2023.\n\nThe minutes from the June meeting suggest the RBA is on a pre-set course as the central bank looks to complete the \u201csecond $100 billion of purchases in early September 2021,\u201d and it seems as though Governor Philip Lowe and Co. are in no rush to switch gears as \u201cmonetary policy would be likely to need to remain highly accommodative for some time yet.\u201d In turn, the RBA may utilize its quantitative easing (QE) program throughout the remainder of the year as \u201cmembers thought it would be premature to consider ceasing the program,\u201d and the central bank may keep the door open to further support the economy as the board pledges to \u201cmaintain highly supportive monetary conditions until its goals for employment and inflation were achieved.\u201d\n\nASX 30 Day Interbank Cash Rate Futures (July 2021 Contract)\n\nSource: ASX\n\nIn turn, the ASX 30 Day Interbank Cash Rate Futures continues to reflect speculation for a rate cut, with the July 2021 contract indicating an \u201886% expectation of an interest rate decrease to 0.00% at the next RBA Board meeting.\u2019\n\nAs a result, the Australian Dollar may continue to depreciate against its US counterpart in the third quarter of 2021 as the RBA retains a dovish forward guidance for monetary policy, while the Federal Reserve shows a greater willingness to scale back its emergency measures.\n\nFederal Reserve Prepares to Adjust QE Program\n\nFresh forecasts from Federal Reserve officials indicate a looming shift in monetary policy amid the upward revisions across the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) may adjust the forward guidance over the coming months as \u201ca number of participants suggested that if the economy continued to make rapid progress toward the Committee's goals, it might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchases.\u201d\n\nSource: FOMC\n\nIt seems as though the FOMC will gradually change its tone over the coming months as the central bank now forecasts the US economy to grow 7.0% in 2021, and it remains to be seen if the FOMC will unveil an exit strategy in the third quarter as Chairman Jerome Powell insists that \u201creaching the standard of substantial further progress is still a ways off.\u201d\n\nIn turn, the FOMC may merely attempt to buy time ahead of its next quarterly meeting in September as the central bank vows to \u201cincrease our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made,\u201d but signs of a more robust recovery may encourage Fed officials to taper the QE program sooner rather than later as Chairman Powell and Co. forecast two rate hikes in 2023.\n\nSource: FOMC\n\nThe shift in the interest rate dot plot implies that the FOMC is in the final stages of its easing cycle as \u201creaching the conditions for lift-off will mainly signal that the recovery is strong and no longer requires holding rates near zero,\u201d and Fed officials may start to discuss an exit strategy as the central bank vows to \u201cprovide advance notice before announcing any decision to make changes to our purchases.\u201d\n\nWith that said, speculation for a looming change in Fed policy may keep AUD/USD under pressure in the third quarter of 2021 as the RBA appears to be in no rush to switch gears.\n\nTo read the full Australian Dollar forecast including the technical outlook, download our new 3Q trading guide from the DailyFX Free Trading Guides!\n\n--- Written by David Song, Currency Strategist\n\nFollow me on Twitter at @DavidJSong"}, {"headline": "Australia CFTC AUD NC Net Positions dipped from previous $-17.6K to $-17.8K", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://staticcontent.fxstreet.com/website/static-html/favicon.ico", "author": [], "body": "Information on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Because of this, the market is likely to continue going lower given enough time, unless of course we can recapture the 200 day EMA. If we were to break above the 200 day EMA, which currently sits at the 0.7550 level, then it at least sets up the possibility of a recovery.

With that being the case, the self-immolation of the Australian economy of course will work against the value of the currency in and of itself.

Therefore, we expect BTC/USD to reach towards the next resistance at $38,000.\n\nCryptocurrency heat map. Source: Coin360\n\nThe overall market trades in the green over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin has increased by 2.53 percent, while Ethereum by almost 5 percent. Uniswap (UNI) is among the best performers, with a gain of over 9 percent.\n\nBitcoin price movement in the last 24 hours\n\nBTC/USD traded in a range of $34,314 \u2013 $35,662, indicating a substantial amount of volatility. Trading volume has remained relatively flat, around $25.5 billion. Meanwhile, the total market capitalization trades around $664.5 billion, resulting in market dominance of 45.3 percent.\n\nBTC/USD 4-hour chart \u2013 BTC ready to move higher?\n\nOn the 4-hour chart, we can see the Bitcoin price rallying higher over the last 24 hours after setting a higher low, indicating that further upside is expected next week.\n\nThe overall market has moved sideways over the past weeks. After a substantial retracement in May, support was finally found around the $31,000 mark. From there, BTC/USD started moving sideways around the $35,000 \u2013 $38,000 area serving as the middle of the trading range.\n\nIn the middle of June, BTC/USD started rallying again, and a higher high was set around $41,000. This indicated that bulls are building momentum to push the market higher. However, the further upside was not seen over the following weeks, and ETH/USD moved lower again.\n\nThe $31,000 support was broken with a quick spike lower to the $29,000 mark. From there, the Bitcoin price started rallying and set both a higher low and high, meaning another reversal for the overall price action structure.\n\nThis price action development has resulted in another retracement earlier this week to the $31,000 support. A base from which to move higher was established, and BTC/USD started pushing to set a new higher high around $38,000. Therefore, we expect BTC to move higher later today and set a much more serious recovery later this month.\n\nBitcoin Price Analysis: Conclusion\n\nBitcoin price analysis is bullish for today as bulls have pushed the market higher over the last 24 hours after a significantly higher low was set earlier this week. Therefore, we expect BTC/USD to move higher early next week and reach the next resistance at $38,000.\n\nWhile waiting for Bitcoin to reach $38,000, read our latest guides on Bitcoin fees, DeFi advantages, as well as what you can buy with Bitcoin.\n\nDisclaimer.

In doing so, it prompted its 50-day simple moving average (SMA) to flip below its 200-day SMA, a phenomenon that technical chartists call a \"death cross\" and see its formation as a sign of extended sell-offs ahead.\n\nBut, at the same time, Bitcoin bulls held the price above the 50-week SMA. The cryptocurrency's one-day chart showed bears' attempts to crash the price below its 50-week SMA. But bulls bought those dips every time.\n\nWillful buy actions near the 50-week SMA later led to a strong upside rebound towards the 61.8% Fib level that constituted a dropdown Fibonacci retracement graph, drawn from around the $14,000-swing high to approximately the$6,500-swing low.\n\nBitcoin 2019 price action. Source: TradingView.com\n\nThe 2019 fractal also illustrated at least two bullish divergence scenarios, wherein the Bitcoin price formed lower lows while its daily relative strength indicator, a price-momentum oscillator, made lower highs. It hinted weakness in the prevailing bearish momentum. And as it turned out, the price soared later.\n\n2021\n\nIn 2021, Bitcoin reconstructed the 2019 scenario halfway. At first, the cryptocurrency's correction from its record high of nearly $65,000 landed BTC/USD right at the same 50-week SMA support around $30,000. At the same time, its move lower enabled a death cross setup.\n\nBitcoin's price action in the past week also hinted at a bullish divergence scenario, as shown in the chart below.\n\nBitcoin's April-June price action. Source: TradingView.com\n\nTradingShot, a market analytics platform, noted that a bullish divergence formation, coupled with a rebound from the 50-week SMA support, could again send Bitcoin prices to the 61.8% Fib level of the current top-to-bottom Fibonacci retracement graph.\n\n\"The support of the 1W MA50 is key as it is being achieved despite Bitcoin being on Lower Lows (LL) while the 1D RSI is on Higher Lows (HL),\" he explained.\n\n\"This is a Bullish Divergence and was also seen during October and late November-early Dec 2019. This divergence was enough to start the rebound to the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level.\"\n\nBitcoin 2019 and 2021 fractal. Source: TradingShot.com\n\nIn a chart provided by TradingShot, the 61.8% Fib level appeared near $47,500. Meanwhile, the other chart above showed the profit target near $50,000.\n\nFundamentals\n\nThe statements appeared as Bitcoin closed its second quarter at a 41% loss, logging its worst declines since the 43% sell-off in the fourth quarter of 2018. The cryptocurrency's recent drop took cues from a flurry of negative fundamentals, including China's crackdown on the crypto industry, global regulators increasing their scrutiny, and as well as Elon Musk's anti-Bitcoin tweets.\n\nMeanwhile, demand for Bitcoin also declined after the Federal Reserve's hawkish tone. The U.S. central bank announced that it might hike its benchmark interest rates by the end of 2023 to curb inflationary pressures, coinciding with a BTC/USD rate plunge on June 16 and afterward.\n\nDespite strong headwinds, Bitcoin managed to float above $30,000, a psychological support level and is currently back above $35,000. However, the equally strong resistance level at $40,000 is keeping the cryptocurrency's short-term bearish bias intact.\n\n\"One expects that the longer we go without a $40,000-handle, eventually support is going to crumble and give way to a sharp move towards $20,000,\" Fawad Razaqzada, an analyst at ThinkMarkets, told the Wall Street Journal, noting that it leaves Bitcoin at crossroads in the third quarter.\n\nTradingShot added:\n\n\"Have all the negative fundamentals priced in already? We can't know for sure but if they have, the Bullish Divergence on the 1D RSI definitely shows something.\"\n\nThe views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

Will this trend change in the coming days?\n\nOn Sunday, July 4, the Bitcoin price is just above $35k. The first cryptocurrency fell in price after failing to gain a foothold above the $36k mark at the end of June. The price had dropped to $32k on Friday, where it found traction amid a weaker US Dollar.\n\nBTC/USD on Fed\u2019s hawkishness\n\nThe Fed\u2019s fresh hawkish reiteration about cutting the bond-buying program sooner than expected weighed on the BTC/USD during the week and put the rally on the backfoot.\n\nBTC/USD on NFP\n\nThe NFP data disappointed the Greenback investors as unemployment rose to 5.8% for June. Despite the upsurge in jobs, the US Dollar could not retain the rally and eventually provided support to the BTC/USD. The cryptocurrency began rising from under $33k and is now posting gains above $35k.\n\nWhat\u2019s more to come?\n\nIn the spring, during the weekend, strong price movements took place on the crypto market. However, in recent weeks, the situation has changed, and now trading is calmer.\n\nThis weekend, one should not expect a fundamental change in the dynamics of bitcoin. But consolidation is observed locally at the bottom range of $30-42k, which is relevant for the new month.\n\nThe consolidation above or below the boundaries of this consolidation will signal the development of a directed movement towards the breakout with the prospect of moving to an amplitude equal to $10-12k.\n\nSummer is a period of vacations, and statistically, there is no abnormal activity in the financial markets, explained Andrey Podolyan, CEO of Cryptorg Exchange. That\u2019s why in the past few weeks, nothing special has happened on the crypto market on the weekend.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is currently squeezed in the so-called sticky zone from $31k to $35k and is unlikely to overcome these boundaries at the weekend,\u201d the expert concluded.\n\nBTC/USD technical view: More upside to come?\n\nThe price managed to move beyond the 20-period SMA on the 4-hour chart. But the volume is too low on the weekend, lying below the average, which means that sellers might have closed their positions during the weekend that helped the buyers temporarily dominate the market. Apparently, the path of least resistance lies on the upside, with next targets at 36,650 ahead of 39,200 and then 41,300.\n\nLooking to trade forex now?

Closely, on top of the point earlier mentioned, there is a conjoining outlook of both the smaller SMA and the bearish trend-line. The 50-day SMA indicator is above the 14-day SMA trend-line. The Stochastic Oscillators are in a state of trying to cross the lines northbound close below a range of 80. That signifies that some pressures to the upside are somewhat in the womb of time.\n\nWill there be a prolongation of the move in the BTC/USD operations as its price oscillates?\n\nOnly a suddenly fearful movement of the BTC/USD market at the trading level of $35,000 will probably suggest what could be the next definite direction. A downward push could mainly be the usual term that allows the crypto economy to find support in no time. Most of those levels below the value earlier mentioned are decent potential buying zones as far as the current cycle technical analysis of this crypto-trade is concerned.\n\n\n\nUntil the present, the main barrier trading zones against the smooth uptrend of this crypto economy are around $35,000 and $40,000. Bears may have to be on the lookout for a pause of price movement, possibly a reversal coupled with active motion around those levels before making a come-back again into the market. In the meantime, the market tends to oscillate furthermore around the lower value for a while.\n\n\n\nBTC/USD 4-hour Chart\n\nFrom a closer technical point of viewing, the BTC/USD on the medium-term analysis chart shows that the crypto\u2019s price oscillates around the values of $32,000 and $36,000 from June 19 or thereabout until now. Both the SMAs are also in those values. The 50-day SMA indicator is closely above the 14-day SMA trend-line. The Stochastic Oscillators are in the overbought region, stretching their line northbound to somewhat indicate that a buying force is ongoing. However, the market\u2019s force is low action that buyers in the short-term cannot rely upon.\n\nLooking to buy or trade Bitcoin (BTC) now?

However, BTC/USD is now confined in a tight range between $31,000 and $35,000. The crypto\u2019s upward move has been restricted below $35,000 high as buying dries up at the resistance zone. For example, today buyers are struggling below the $35,000 resistance to break above it. If they are successful above the resistance zone, Bitcoin will rise to retest the $41,273 high. This will be an uphill task as Bitcoin lacks buyers at higher price levels. Presently, Bitcoin is facing rejection at the $35,000 resistance zone. If the market faces rejection at the recent high, the Bitcoin range-bound move will continue for few more days.\n\nRussia\u2019s Central Bank to Study Crypto Investment Risks\n\nThe Bank of Russia will collect data from 15 credit organizations on Russia\u2019s assessment of crypto-related risks comes amid growing criticism. In the past, local lawmakers and businesses have criticized the government regarding the institution\u2019s tough stance on the crypto industry. These 15 credit organizations include major banks like Sberbank, VTB, and Tinkoff Bank, payment systems like Visa and Mastercard, and electronic payment providers like Western Union, Qiwi, and WebMoney. Russia\u2019s central bank has organized a risk assessment screening program for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin for the second half of 2021. According to the report, the examination of the potential risks of cryptocurrency investing will consider \u201csystemic risks linked to cryptocurrency investment by Russian individuals and entities.\u201d In addition, the Bank of Russia is also looking to release a study on equity investment by non-resident investors by October or November 2021. The Bank of Russia will inaugurate the first pilot group for testing the country\u2019s central bank digital currency, the digital ruble.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin bulls are struggling to break above the $35,000 resistance as Bitcoin underlying strength weakens. The breaking of this initial resistance will accelerate the upward movement of the coin. There is an indication that the king coin will lose the $30,000 support if buyers fail to clear the $35,000 resistance. In the meantime, Bitcoin is consolidating below the $35,000 resistance. A rebound above the $34,000 support will propel price to break above the resistance zone.\n\nLooking to buy or trade Bitcoin (BTC) now?

Numerous third-parties now operate within its ecosystem.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSure, it\u2019s still far away from starting to give Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) a run for its money, or the \u201cEthereum killers,\u201d like Cardano (CCC:ADA-USD), for that matter.\n\nYet, with its smart contract capabilities, solid transaction speeds, and focus on being a bridge between centralized and decentralized systems, it does look set to quickly enter that category.\n\nTo top it all off, as InvestorPlace\u2019s Tezcan Gecgil recently discussed, it\u2019s a carbon-negative platform.\n\nThis by itself may not help it become one of the most widely-used cryptos out there. But, as proof-of-work cryptos like Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) get called out for their environmental impact, it\u2019s another positive for this proof-of-stake blockchain.\n\nIts prospects may look bright, but, keep in mind this may not immediately translate into higher prices for its native token.\n\nUncertainty continues to hang over the crypto market. It may have more room to fall before it finds its floor. Keep this risk in mind, as it trades for around 83 cents, down big from its all-time high of $3.28.\n\nAlgorand and its Initial Success\n\nIn the two years since going live, this token\u2019s blockchain has seen rapid adoption, from a variety of third-parties.\n\nA recent one of note is MAPay. The healthcare payments processor is using the network to facilitate over $800 million in payments for Bermuda\u2019s healthcare system.\n\nWith this initial success, crypto funds have invested $500 million in projects that run on the Algorand blockchain.\n\nStory continues\n\nGiven what it\u2019s accomplished so far, it\u2019s easy to see continuing to gain in usage in the years ahead. Especially as it continues to launch protocol upgrades, such as one launched recently that improves smart contract development and dApp functionality.\n\nIt\u2019s clear it has the technology. All it needs now is critical mass. With the larger \u201cEthereum killers\u201d offering up similar advantages, this may be a challenge.\n\nAssuming it attracts more capital for its development and its upgrades allow it to continue \u201cleveling up,\u201d it looks primed to become a front-runner, like Cardano, or Polygon (CCC:MATIC-USD).\n\nAlgorand\u2019s best days may lie ahead. A few years down the road it could be worth many times what it trades for today.\n\nBut, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s all uphill from here. As crypto market uncertainty still looms, it may first make a trip back toward its pre-bubble prices.\n\nDespite Strengths, ALGO Could See Another Pullback\n\nAs of this writing, cryptos across the board are trading sideways. This may signal to some that we\u2019ve reached the \u201cbottom,\u201d after the sell-off that kicked off in mid-May.\n\nThe waters have been calm. But, we may not have seen the end to the sell-off just yet. The market could still have room to pull back further, before the dust has truly settled.\n\nAlgorand prices could see another double-digit percentage decline. Or worse, a brief trip back under 50 cents per token. That\u2019s where it traded for, prior to the early 2021 bubble. If you do buy it today, be aware of possible near-term volatility.\n\nThere may be a silver lining: a continuation of the crypto bear market could be short-lived. Once speculators who dived into this space late in the game (that is, earlier this year) cash out, but long-minded \u201cHODLers\u201d sit tight, things could bounce back sooner rather than later.\n\nAdmittedly, this may not guarantee a fast trip for cryptos back to their respective high-water marks. It may just mean an end to the declines, with several years of middling performance ahead.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened after the last crash, in 2018. Yet, if you\u2019re looking at this as a long-term crypto investment, and not a short-term trade, this may not be a big concern.\n\nBottom Line: A Possible \u201cEthereum Killer\u201d in the Making\n\nConsidering its capabilities and features, along with its gaining usage, this \u201cnew kid on the crypto block\u201d stands to soon enter \u201cEthereum killer\u201d territory.\n\nThis may make it one one of the better altcoin opportunities you can get in at the ground floor on. Even so, keep in mind the high-risk, and high volatility ahead.\n\nDepending on how long today\u2019s crypto bear market lasts, Algorand may pull back to 50 cents before it bounces back above $1, but if you can handle the volatility and hold it until its blockchain grows in usage, starting to accumulate a position at or below today\u2019s prices appears worthwhile.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel held long positions in Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Meanwhile, if the coin struggles to show any distinctive price movement, traders are generally cautious about this movement. However, over the medium to long term, many traders expect the Bitcoin price to recover and perceive the ongoing consolidation phase as a healthy pullback.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction: Where is BTC Price Going Next?\n\nSo far, the Bitcoin price successfully stays above the $34,000 level and continues to trade above the 9-day moving average but still below the 21-day moving average. Recently, the coin even spiked to touch the daily high of $34,953 during the early trading session as the technical indicator Relative Strength Index (14) remains above the 45-level.\n\nAt the time of writing, it seems like BTC/USD might stay clear of the gap, with the cryptocurrency trading under its recent resistance level of $35,000. Meanwhile, from a technical perspective, the king-coin has to fight off the first resistance at $38,000 before having a chance to aim at $40,000, $42,000, and $44,000 resistance levels. On the contrary, any bearish movement below the 9-day and 21-day moving averages may likely lead to the critical supports at $29,000, $27,000, and $25,000.\n\nBTC/USD Medium \u2013 Term Trend: Ranging (4H Chart)\n\nThere are several signs showing that Bitcoin (BTC) is poised for a significant move to the upside. However, the price action of the past few hours formed a bullish movement on the 4-hour chart which appears to have broken out with a decent move towards $34,800. Similarly, the Relative Strength Index (14) is notably squeezing, indicating that high volatility may come into play.\n\nMeanwhile, the 9-day MA is making an attempt to cross above the 21-day MA and additional resistance levels could be achieved. However, a move above the $35,000 level with a strong close above it may likely push the Bitcoin price up to the resistance level of $36,000 and above while the support levels are located at $33,500 and below.\n\nLooking to buy or trade Bitcoin (BTC) now?

Japan has accused the exchange of operating without proper registration, and toughened measures in the Canadian province of Ontario have prompted Binance to announce that it plans to cease all operations there.\n\nMonday saw Binance suspend the use of Faster Payments in the U.K., meaning that it would take longer for British customers to withdraw pounds from the exchange. This came days after the Financial Conduct Authority told the exchange to cease all regulated activities in the country. However, this was later reinstated.\n\nThailand\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission and the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority are the latest financial regulators to announce a regulatory crackdown on Binance.\n\nAs a major global exchange, the exchange has been struggling to find the right jurisdiction for operating its business.\n\nBitcoin.org has blocked U.K. visitors from downloading Bitcoin Core software, as well as the whitepaper authored by Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nIt comes days after a British court ruled in favor of self-proclaimed Bitcoin creator Craig Wright.\n\nHe had accused Bitcoin.org and its current operator C\u00f8bra of copyright infringement for hosting the BTC whitepaper in the U.K.\n\nC\u00f8bra elected not to mount a defense in order to protect their anonymity \u2014 and was also ordered to pay interim legal costs of \u00a335,000 (about $48,600.)\n\nThe judgment is the latest salvo in Wright\u2019s assault on people who dispute his claim of being Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nPayments platform Strike has announced that it will allow U.S. customers to buy and sell Bitcoin with almost no trading fees \u2014 taking on the likes of Coinbase, Square and PayPal.\n\nStrike\u2019s founder and CEO Jack Mallers says his platform is setting out to be the \u201ccheapest and easiest place on the planet to acquire BTC.\u201d\n\nMallers has taken aim directly at Coinbase too, describing Coinbase\u2019s fees as \u201casinine.\u201d He added: \u201cMake no mistake, when you buy Bitcoin on Coinbase, you are supporting shitcoins.\u201d\n\nIn other developments, Coinbase has revealed that it plans to list digital assets on its exchange faster than it does now. And as the exchange seeks to bolster its global presence, it\u2019s going to launch a crypto app store offering products developed by third parties.\n\nMeanwhile, Robinhood has filed an application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering. That application came a day after regulators ordered the company to pay a $70 million penalty, amid allegations it caused \u201cwidespread and significant harm\u201d to thousands of users.\n\nDogecoin prices surged but did not skyrocket after receiving another endorsement from Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Thursday.\n\nMusk\u2019s first tweet declared \u201cRelease the Doge!\u201d \u2014 sending the joke cryptocurrency up 8.42% to $0.261. A sell-off followed suit, taking DOGE/USD down to $0.247.\n\nLess than an hour later, Musk tweeted a rather unusual message that said: \u201cBaby Doge, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, Baby Doge, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, Baby Doge, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, Baby Doge.\u201d\n\nDOGE/USD subsequently rose 5.22% to $0.26 after the second tweet.\n\nThis is modest compared with the wild gains we\u2019ve seen after Musk\u2019s tweets in the past.\n\nWinners and Losers\n\nAt the end of the week, Bitcoin is at $34,544.52, Ether at $2,219.30 and XRP at $0.2469.

begin with our monthly and weekly forecasts of the currency pairs worth watching. The first part of our forecast is based upon our research of the past 18 years of Forex prices, which show that the following methodologies have all produced profitable results:\n\nLet us look at the relevant data of currency price changes and interest rates to date, which we compiled using a trade-weighted index of the major global currencies:\n\nMonthly Forecast July 2021\n\nFor the month of July, we forecast that the EUR/USD currency pair will fall in value, while the USD/JPY currency pair will rise in value.\n\nFor the month of June, we forecasted that the USD/CAD currency pair would fall in value, and the CAD/JPY currency cross would rise in value. The final performance of this forecast is shown below:\n\nWeekly Forecast 4th July 2021\n\nLast week, we made no weekly forecast, as there were no large counter-trend price movements in any important currency pairs or crosses.\n\nWe again make no forecast this week.\n\nThe Forex market saw its level of volatility drop sharply last week, with not one single important currency pair or cross moving by more than 1% in value. Volatility is likely to remain low over the coming week.\n\nLast week was dominated by relative strength in the U.S. dollar, and relative weakness in the Australian dollar, but the numbers were so small as to be practically negligible.\n\nYou can trade our forecasts in a real or demo Forex brokerage account.\n\nPrevious Monthly Forecasts\n\nYou can view the results of our previous monthly forecasts here.\n\nKey Support/Resistance Levels for Popular Pairs\n\nWe teach that trades should be entered and exited at or very close to key support and resistance levels. There are certain key support and resistance levels that can be watched on the more popular currency pairs this week.\n\nThat is all for this week. You can trade our forecasts in a real or demo Forex brokerage account to test the strategies and strengthen your self-confidence before investing real funds.Key Support and Resistance Levels"}, {"headline": "CAD/JPY Bullish Breakout Potential Near Five-Year-Highs: Q3 Top Trading Opportunities", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "DailyFX", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://a.c-dn.net/b/2eiI1p/headline_CANADIAN_DOLLAR_2.JPG", "author": ["James Stanley", "Senior Strategist"], "body": "CAD/JPY Talking Points:\n\nThis is part of the DailyFX Q3 Top Trades.\n\nSee the favorite trades from each DailyFX Analyst for the third quarter. Download our new 3Q top trading opportunities guide from the DailyFX Free Trading Guides .\n\nYen weakness returned in Q2 as the risk-on trade ran with a full head of steam. US equities notched fresh all-time-highs and US Dollar bears made their mark in the first two months of the quarter, with a notable pullback showing in June around the FOMC rate decision.\n\nBut, it was at that same rate decision that kickstarted a round of US Dollar strength that FOMC Chair, Jerome Powell, said that market participants should take the dot plot matrix and the Fed\u2019s forecasts with a grain of salt. That\u2019s what helped to really propel stocks, and risk assets, as it became clear once again that the world\u2019s largest national central bank is backstopping markets and apparently happy to continue doing so.\n\nThis does create some interesting dynamics elsewhere, however, such as around the Japanese Yen and the Canadian Dollar.\n\nThe Bank of Canada created some surprise in April when they became one of the first globalized central banks to start talking about post-pandemic policy. This led to a strong run of Canadian Dollar strength that was similarly supported by rising oil prices. The Bank of Japan, however, continues to hold negative rates as they have since 2016. And there appears to be little sign of anything changing on that front, even as a potential shift appears ahead of or around the Federal Reserve.\n\nThis has supported a strong trend in CAD/JPY that\u2019s propelled the pair up to fresh three-year-highs. And very nearby is an important watermark, plotted at 91.64 which is the current five-year high in the pair.\n\nCAD/JPY Monthly Price Chart\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; CADJPY on Tradingview\n\nCAD/JPY Bullish Breakout Potential\n\nA big technical item took place in CAD/JPY during the month of May when price action broke above a descending trendline that\u2019s connecting 2018 and 2014 swing highs. This also came along with a test above the psychological 90 level.\n\nThis keeps the door open for bullish breakout potential ahead of the Q3 open, and this can be followed by first looking for a test of the five-year-high plotted at 91.64, after which another interesting spot opens on the chart around 93.25. If buyers can push through here, then the 95.00 psychological level would be the next big spot to follow.\n\nCAD/JPY Weekly Price Chart\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; CADJPY on Tradingview\n\n--- Written by James Stanley, Senior Strategist for DailyFX.com\n\nContact and follow James on Twitter: @JStanleyFX"}, {"headline": "USD/CAD on the fence ahead of US jobs report", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "Forexlive", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://az705044.vo.msecnd.net/20210702/2-7-2021-6-40-34-pm.png", "author": [], "body": "The loonie is holding its ground in European trading\n\n\n\n\n\nUSD/CAD was up earlier to a high of 1.2449 but is now tracking lower to the lows for the day at 1.2418 as the loonie regains some momentum after a sluggish week against the dollar, despite higher oil prices in the lead up to the OPEC+ decision.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat may tell us quite a bit of how solid the dollar's performance has been and from a technical perspective, it has seen USD/CAD break above 1.2400 and even its 100-day moving average (red line) once again - after having briefly done so in June.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast month, the break against the latter technical level was short-lived as buyers failed to get close to contest the 1.2500 level and so the highs then @ 1.2481-87 offers a key resistance region going into the US jobs report later today.\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the hawkish tilt by the BOC, you'd have to figure that the latest bounce since mid-June owes much to a technical rejection of 1.2000 at its first attempt.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut if the BOC is going to play it slow now that the Fed itself is starting to turn the other cheek, then loonie gains may be less straightforward to come by than it was in the opening five months of the year.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we break back above 1.2500, I can see this heading towards the 200-day moving average (blue line) @ 1.2670 next.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat said, with the BOC likely to push forward with its agenda, the Canadian economy looking more optimistic, and oil prices to stay more upbeat, it is tough to fit the solid fundamental backdrop that is supporting the loonie at the moment.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs mentioned before, on the balance of things, I would argue that USD/CAD is likely headed towards another test of 1.2000 but that conviction isn't what it was pre-FOMC.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe technical element now is also part of the consideration, with dollar gains ahead of the payrolls later adding to the recent upside pressure in the pair.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs such, as mentioned before, there is a stronger argument that this latest shift in the landscape calls for a stronger loonie against the likes of the franc and yen in the long-term, given rate differentials and policy/economic divergence.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut of course, timing is everything so be wary of potential retracements considering how CAD/JPY was already the best performer in 1H 2021."}, {"headline": "CAD/JPY Increases Ahead of International Merchandise Trade Release", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://mlmhhbc485aw.i.optimole.com/ltER-78-JsCXf58R/w:auto/h:auto/q:90/https://fxdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/canadian-dollar-4511616_640.png", "author": ["Usman Ahmed"], "body": "Since the last three days, the Canadian dollar (CAD) has begun to recover against the Japanese yen (JPY).

RSI is also pointing up to show a return in bullish pressure, even though it was previously heading south.\n\nThere are no major reports due from Canada or Japan for the rest of the week, but volatility around the US NFP release might have an impact on this pair.\n\nIn particular, a strong read might revive Fed tightening hopes, which would then be negative for risk-taking. After all, higher borrowing costs could weigh on business and consumer activity in the near-term.\n\nOn the other hand, another NFP miss could keep risk-taking in play, as traders anticipate a longer period of stimulus. In turn, this could be bearish for the safe-haven yen.\n\nDo note that the OPEC+ has delayed its ministerial meeting to discuss adjustments to their output deal, allowing crude oil to hold on to its gains.

recovery will be a key driver of exchange rates\n\nFed tightening will support the dollar against the Euro and yen\n\nEUR/USD to weaken from current 1.18 to 1.15 by end 2022.\n\nAttractive valuations will support the Pound Sterling.\n\nStrong export earnings will underpin commodity currencies.\n\nForeign exchange analysts at BNP expects the dollar to make gains over the next 18 months. The advance is expected to be limited given the overall lack of yield support with gains concentrated against the Euro, yen and Swiss franc.\n\nThe bank expects relatively narrow ranges will prevail in global exchange rates.\n\nUS Dollar Advance against Low-Yield Currencies\n\nBNP Paribas expects that a stronger global economy will be a key driver of exchange rates over the second half of 2021.\n\nAs far as the dollar is concerned, the bank expects that the Federal Reserve will take a measured step towards policy tightening, especially with strong US demand.\n\n\u201cAs the US recovery proceeds and the Fed gets closer to reducing policy accommodation, we expect US real yields to edge up.\u201d\n\nBNP expects that the increase in yields will provide an element of dollar support, but the absolute level of yields will remain relatively unattractive. In this environment, the dollar gains are likely to be concentrated against currencies where central banks will be even slower to tighten monetary policy.\n\nBNP looks at longer-term trends from economic cycles and notes that the dollar tends to strengthen ahead of Federal Reserve interest rate increases before weakening once rates actually increase.\n\n\u201cUSD gains are likely to be most pronounced versus currencies where the market cannot price a meaningful exit from easy monetary policy, notably the CHF, JPY and EUR.\u201d\n\nThe Euro to Dollar (EUR/USD) exchange rate is forecast to weaken to 1.1400 at the end of 2022.\n\nExport Earnings Boost Commodity Currencies\n\nAs the global economy tends to normalise, BNP expects there will be investor support for currencies where there are strong commodity earnings or interest rates are expected to increase.\n\n\u201cIn contrast, we expect a number of emerging market and G10 currencies with commodity exposure or where central banks are likely to hike in tandem with \u2013 or ahead of \u2013 the Fed to hold up well and even outperform the USD.\u201d\n\nIn this context, it expects that commodity currencies will maintain a firm tone and hold their own against the US currency.\n\nPound Sterling (GBP) Exchange Rates Remain Attractive\n\nBNP remains constructive surrounding the Pound Sterling outlook. The bank expects that there is scope for UK yields to increase further as the Bank of England is likely to be one of the early movers in removing policy accommodation.\n\n\u201cComparing the market pricing for rate hikes across the G10, the Bank of England looks conservatively priced, especially considering its less-restrictive forward guidance.\u201d\n\nUK assets continued to under-perform in the 2016-2020 period as Brexit uncertainty curb investor inflows. According to BNP, there is scope for a further catch-up effect over the next few months.\n\n\u201cWe also maintain our positive view on UK equities, as these have lagged the broader rotation into Value stocks, and this could benefit the GBP.\u201d\n\nThe Euro to Pound (EUR/GBP) exchange rate is forecast to weaken to 0.83 at the end of 2022.\n\nAbove: Table of currency forecasts from BNP Paribas covering period 2021-2022."}, {"headline": "Exchange rates predict exchange rates: USD/JPY and JPY cross pairs", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "FXStreet", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "https://editorial.fxstreet.com/images/Markets/Currencies/Majors/USDJPY/usdjpy_Large.jpg", "author": [], "body": "For the second instance over the past 4 weeks, all JPY cross pairs are at, near, or broke vital support points.

Having been one of the most relaxed of the major central banks about exiting its extraordinary monetary policy, the Fed is now among the few that has indicated a timetable \u2013 and one that could be accelerated, at that. The \u201cmonetary policy divergence\u201d that was causing the dollar to weaken is now likely to move into reverse and cause the US currency to strengthen, in my view.\n\nThe Committee upgraded its forecasts for activity and inflation.\n\nBut more than the numbers, the commentary in the statement that followed the meeting and especially in Fed Chair Powell\u2019s press conference shows that they are much more confident about the future than before. While their forecasts maintained the view that the recent sharp rise in inflation is only temporary, Powell admitted that \u201cinflation could turn out to be higher and more persistent than we expect\u201d \u2013 a significant concession. He also said that \u201cthere\u2019s every reason to think that we\u2019ll be in a labor market with very attractive numbers, with low unemployment, high participation, and rising wages across the spectrum.\u201d\n\nUpgrading the economic forecasts wasn\u2019t a surprise. If anything, I was surprised at how little they upgraded the forecasts given the improvement in the US economy and the rise in inflation since the March meeting.\n\nThe big surprise though was how they raised their forecasts for interest rates. Whereas in March the median member saw no rise in rates before the end of 2023, now the median is for not one but two hikes in rates by then. On top of which, seven of the 18 members expect to raise rates next year (vs only four in March) and eight of the 18 look for three or more rate hikes by the end of 2023.\n\nMembers are now predicting rate hikes despite relatively small changes to their growth and unemployment forecasts. The table below shows how the forecasts changed from March to June compared to how they changed from December to March. They boosted their growth and economic forecasts much more in March and yet then they still expected rates to be unchanged through 2023. (Note too that while the 2021 inflation forecasts have risen considerably, the longer-term inflation forecasts haven\u2019t gone up much at all.),\n\nBack in March, the fact that they expected the economy to improve so much but didn\u2019t see rates rising implied that they were happy to see falling real yields. That was consistent with its new average inflation targeting regime (\u201cfollowing periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.\u201d) As it raised its growth and inflation forecasts but not its interest rate forecasts, its implied forecast for real interest rates fell and the dollar weakened.\n\nBut now, with the Fed clearly setting a limit to its patience and warning of a possible overshoot to inflation, real yields have risen and the dollar has risen with them. Expectations of higher real yields are likely to support the dollar going forward.\n\nHow does the Fed\u2019s position compare with that of other central banks?\n\nThe Fed is now one of the few major central banks that has set a time limit, however flexible, to its zero-interest-rate policy. The only other ones that are specific are the Bank of Canada and Norges Bank. At their last meetings, they said:\n\nBank of Canada: We remain committed to holding the policy interest rate at the effective lower bound until economic slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is sustainably achieved. In the Bank\u2019s April projection, this happens sometime in the second half of 2022.\n\nNorges Bank: Further easing of Covid-related restrictions will help a return to more normal economic conditions. This suggests that it will soon be appropriate to raise the policy rate from the current level\u2026The policy rate forecast is slightly higher than in the March 2021 Monetary Policy Report and implies a gradual rise from autumn 2021.\n\nIn addition, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand is ambiguous. Their most recent statement read, The Committee agreed to maintain its current stimulatory monetary settings until it is confident that consumer price inflation will be sustained near the 2 percent per annum target midpoint, and that employment is at its maximum sustainable level. Meeting these requirements will necessitate considerable time and patience.\u201d However, the accompanying Monetary Policy Statement (MPS) reinstated their \u201clong-standing practice of publishing an OCR projection.\u201d This projection included a rate hike in Q3 2021 to 0.5% from the current 0.25%, rising to 1.8% by Q2 2024.\n\nThe other central banks generally set out the conditions that they would need to see before raising rates, but without any time scale (except for Australia, which specifies that it won\u2019t happen before a certain time at the earliest \u2013 giving no indication of when it might happen).\n\nECB: The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it has seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within its projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics.\n\nBank of Japan: The Bank will continue with Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner.\n\nBank of England: The Committee does not intend to tighten monetary policy at least until there is clear evidence that significant progress is being made in eliminating spare capacity and achieving the 2% inflation target sustainably.\n\nReserve Bank of Australia: (The Board) will not increase the cash rate until actual inflation is sustainably within the 2 to 3 percent target range. For this to occur, the labour market will need to be tight enough to generate wages growth that is materially higher than it is currently. This is unlikely to be until 2024 at the earliest.\n\nSwiss National Bank: no hint at all at what might get them to change policy. They consistently say, \u201cWe are keeping the SNB policy rate and interest on sight deposits at the SNB at \u22120.75%, and remain willing to intervene in the foreign exchange market as necessary, while taking the overall currency situation into consideration.\u201d\n\nSveriges Riksbank: The Executive Board has now decided \u2026to hold the repo rate unchanged at zero percent. The repo rate is expected to remain at this level during the forecast period [until 2024 Q2]\u2026 It is also entirely possible to cut the repo rate, particularly if confidence in the inflation target were under threat.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s move may allow some of these central banks to start normalizing policy earlier than they would have before. For example, the ECB and RBA have both pointed to the way their easing measures weakened their currency as a beneficial side-effect (or primary effect perhaps) of their monetary policy. Now they can start \u201cthinking about thinking about\u201d normalizing policy without having to worry about their currencies going through the roof. This will aid those currencies whose central banks have room to start hiking rates and penalize those that are likely to wait longer before moving. The former group probably includes CAD, NZD, and GBP, while the latter includes AUD, EUR, JPY, and CHF. JPY and CHF seem particularly vulnerable once a global hiking cycle begins, JPY because Japan alone remains in deflation and CHF because the SNB is not going to move until well after the ECB has.\n\nNext week: Bank of England, Powell testimony, preliminary PMIs, US PCE deflator\n\nThere are a number of points of interest for the market next week. The main points will be the results of the Bank of England meeting on Thursday, the preliminary purchasing managers\u2019 indices for the major industrial countries on Wednesday, and the US personal consumption expenditure deflators on Friday. In addition nine members of the FOMC will be speaking (some twice), including Fed Chair Powell\u2019s testimony to Congress on Tuesday.\n\nBank of England meeting: No change likely\n\nThe Bank of England meeting will be significant to see if the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) becomes any bolder in light of the Fed\u2019s change to a tightening bias. The MPC has several domestic reasons that would support a more hawkish stance Since their last meeting in May, growth has accelerated\u2026\n\nInflation has moved back to their target level\u2026\n\nUnemployment has fallen and the number of jobs has increased for two months in a row...\n\nAnd wages are rising at the fastest pace since before the Global Financial Crisis, suggesting that the labor market is relatively tight.\n\nThis good news should come as no surprise to the MPC, however. In their May statement they said, \u201cIn the central projections of the MPC\u2019s May Report, the economy experiences a temporary period of strong GDP growth and a temporary period of modestly above-target CPI inflation, after which growth and inflation fall back, with inflation around the target two and three years ahead. In judging the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will, consistent with its policy guidance and as always, focus on the medium-term prospects for inflation, including the balance between demand and supply, rather than factors that are likely to be transient.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, they must be somewhat concerned about the recent pick-up in virus cases and the four-week extension of restrictions. The worsening virus situation may preclude any more hawkish tone at this meeting.\n\nAccordingly, I don\u2019t expect them to make any changes in their policy or their forward guidance. At the last meeting they slowed the pace of purchases for their Asset Purchase Facility but stressed that this was an operational decision with no policy implications. This time I would expect them to be a bit more optimistic about the economy in line with what\u2019s already happened, but that\u2019s about all. GBP could benefit slightly from an improvement in tone.\n\nOther central bank activity\n\nNow that the Fed\u2019s \u201cpurdah\u201d period is over, we are going to get an earful from a wide variety of FOMC members. The most important will be when Fed Chair Powell testifies Tuesday to a House select subcommittee hearing on the COVID-19 crisis to discuss pandemic emergency lending and the economy. After his one-hour press conference Wednesday I wouldn\u2019t expect anything new, but you never know.\n\nMeanwhile, ECB President Lagarde appears in a monetary dialogue with the European Parliament on Monday. Messrs. Guindos and Panetta and Frau Schanbel speak during the week as well.\n\nPCE deflator: The little indicator that should be bigger\n\nAs I mentioned a few weeks ago, the US consumer price index (CPI) is not the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge \u2013 the Fed has been framing its inflation forecasts in terms of the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) deflators since 2000. Look at the tables above that give the FOMC\u2019s economic forecasts \u2013 notice that the inflation forecasts are framed in terms of the PCE deflators, not the CPI.\n\nHowever, the CPI is the market\u2019s preferred inflation gauge. The Bloomberg relevance score for the mom change in the CPI is 96.1, meaning about 96% of the people who have any alerts set for US indicators have an alert set for this indicator. By contrast, the highest figure for any of the PCE deflators is 60.1 for the mom change in the core deflator. That\u2019s quite low \u2013 normally I wouldn\u2019t even bother discussing an indicator with such a low score. I\u2019m at a loss to explain why the market places so much more weight on the CPI than on the PCE deflator when in fact they should be looking at the latter exclusively. My guess is that when people think of \u201cinflation,\u201d they think of \u201cCPI,\u201d not \u201cPCE deflator,\u201d which is a more esoteric concept.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between the two? The basket that they measure of course has some differences. The main one is that medical care in the PCE deflator includes payments by insurance companies, whereas for the CPI it only includes the part that consumers pay themselves \u2013 a big difference, given how expensive US medical care is. They also measure some things differently, such as airfares. But the biggest difference is the weightings given to the components of the basket. The CPI uses a constant basket of goods & services, while the PCE deflator is adjusted to take into account changing consumption patterns. So for example, if chicken becomes more expensive relative to pork, people usually eat less chicken and more pork. The PCE deflator will take this into account and show less of a rise than the CPI, which will keep using the same weight for both. (I\u2019m a vegetarian and so don\u2019t eat either, but it\u2019s still good for an example.).\n\nHere\u2019s how the headline and core measures compare. They generally follow the same path, but the PCE deflator is usually less volatile and shows lower inflation owing to the aforementioned basket effect.\n\nFor May, the PCE deflators are expected to rise further above the Fed\u2019s 2% inflation target, although not as high as the CPI was (as one would expect). The forecast rise in the PCE deflators will only help to convince the FOMC\u2019s members that the risk of inflation is real and cement the idea of higher US rates to come. This should be positive for USD in today\u2019s environment.\n\nOther major US indicators out during the week include personal income & spending, which are released with the PCE deflators; durable goods (Thu), and existing home sales (Tue) and new home sales (Wed).\n\nWe should also watch the initial jobless claims as several states are going to end federal unemployment assistance before it\u2019s officially set to expire on Sept. 6. The states are:\n\nJun. 19: Alabama, Idaho, Indiana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, West Virginia, Wyoming\n\nJun. 26: Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas\n\nJun. 27: Montana, Oklahoma, Utah\n\nJul. 3: Tennessee\n\nJul. 10: Arizona\n\nThe Republicans leading these states believe that high unemployment insurance is discouraging people from taking jobs and so are ending this aid early even though it\u2019s from the Federal government and so doesn\u2019t cost their residents anything. (I say \u201cbelieve\u201d and not \u201cthink\u201d because the research says otherwise.) They are just doing this out of spite. It will be an interesting experiment to see if unemployment in these states does fall faster than in states with continued benefits. On the other hand, with less assistance coming in, many people will have to cut back on their spending. This could cause jobless claims to rise.\n\nPMIs: Continued robust expansion likely\n\nThe purchasing managers\u2019 indices (PMIs) show that the global economy is on the mend.\n\nFor most of the major countries, the service sector PMIs are not only in expansionary territory (above the 50 line) but also have gained over the last several months. The exceptions here are Japan and Brazil, but even those two have been improving at least.\n\nThe manufacturing PMIs are also mostly over the 50 line and rising too. Manufacturing was not hit as hard as the service sector by the pandemic.\n\nI think a lot of attention will focus on Japan\u2019s service-sector PMI, which has been underperforming the rest of the developed world.\n\nWednesday we get the preliminary PMIs from the major industrial economies, including Japan, the Eurozone, the UK and the US. The manufacturing PMIs are expected to be a bit lower, probably because they\u2019re so high to begin with. PMIs don\u2019t climb indefinitely. Levels over 60 still show robust expansion.\n\nThe service-sector PMIs are expected to show large gains for those that are under 60. The US, which is at an unusually high 70.4, is expected to see a small decline \u2013 no surprise there.\n\nAll told these would be good figures that would probably help commodity prices to recover and thereby boost the commodity currencies. They might also boost the dollar at the same time, by reinforcing expectations of tighter Fed policy. Currency pairs such as AUD/JPY and CAD/EUR might be the best way to take advantage of expectations of a stronger global economy.\n\nSpeaking of Japan, we get the Tokyo CPI on Friday. Japan is about the only country in the world that\u2019s still in deflation. It\u2019s expected to stay in deflation in June. This dismal performance is why I expect Japan to be among the last central bank to ever raise rates (a contest with the SNB) and why I think JPY is likely to decline over the medium term as other central banks begin \u201cthinking about thinking about\u201d normalizing their monetary policy.\n\nFinally, the biggest thing to expect this week IMHO: the long-awaited US intelligence agencies\u2019 report to Congress on \u201cunidentified aerial phenomena.\u201d The report is the result of a provision in last year\u2019s $2.3tn coronavirus relief and appropriations bill, which called for a \u201cdetailed analysis of unidentified aerial phenomena data and intelligence\u201d from the Office of Naval Intelligence, the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force and the FBI. The report has to be released by June 25th, so we can expect it sometime this week.\n\nUnfortunately, the report apparently won\u2019t have any big revelations. The New York Times already ran a summary two weeks ago. \u201cU.S. Finds No Evidence of Alien Technology in Flying Objects, but Can\u2019t Rule It Out, Either,\u201d the headline reads. The article explains, \u201cAmerican intelligence officials have found no evidence that aerial phenomena witnessed by Navy pilots in recent years are alien spacecraft, but they still cannot explain the unusual movements that have mystified scientists and the military, according to senior administration officials briefed on the findings of a highly anticipated government report.\u201d So we will be none the wiser but much better informed."}, {"headline": "CHF/JPY in bearish reversal with this week\u2019s selloff?", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Action Forex", "date": "2 weeks ago", "image": "https://www.actionforex.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/f-chf41.jpg", "author": [], "body": "In addition to the strong rally in Dollar and Yen this week, the selloff in Swiss Franc is worth a mention.
