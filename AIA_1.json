"author": ["Christopher Vecchio", "Senior Strategist", "Recommended"], "body": "Advertisement\n\nMarket Minutes Overview:\n\nThe US Dollar (via the DXY Index) is at levels that would constitute its high close for July, just days after the \u2018goldilocks\u2019 June US nonfarm payrolls report.\n\nFalling US Treasury yields and US rate hike expectations draw into question the legitimacy of US Dollar strength.\n\nComing out of the US holiday weekend, and with European football semi-finals this week, various measures of volatility continue to decline.\n\nA Mixed Bag\n\nThe US yield curve is flattening. US equity markets are dipping. Some agricultural commodities are limit down. And with the US Dollar (via the DXY Index) at levels that would constitute its high close for the month despite USD/JPY rates falling back, it appears that markets are in a \u2018risk-off\u2019 mood following the \u2018goldilocks\u2019 June US nonfarm payrolls report and US holiday weekend.\n\nThere may be a good reason to suggest that it\u2019s the risk-off nature of markets pushing the US Dollar higher rather than some domestic-oriented factor: rate hike odds aren\u2019t following.\n\nWe can measure whether a rate hike is being priced-in using Eurodollar contracts by examining the difference in borrowing costs for commercial banks over a specific time horizon in the future. Chart 1 below showcases the difference in borrowing costs \u2013 the spread \u2013 for the July 2021 and December 2023 contracts, in order to gauge where interest rates are headed in the interim period between July 2021 and December 2023.\n\nEurodollar Futures Contract Spread (July 2021-December 2023): Daily Rate Chart (March to July 6, 2021) (Chart 1)\n\nAt their high last week after the June US nonfarm payrolls report, there were 107-bps worth of rate hikes discounted by December 2023; now, there are 92-bps priced-in. Markets are taking a less hawkish view of the FOMC; typically, this has corresponded with US Dollar weakness.\n\nVideo Technical Notes: DXY Index\n\nThe DXY Index is rebounding from familiar territory around the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the 2018 low/2020 high range and the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the 2011 low/2020 high range near 91.90. As a result, a bullish daily outside engulfing bar is forming.\n\nB ullish momentum is firming. The daily 5-EMA continues to serve as support with the entire daily EMA envelope aligned in bullish sequential order. Daily MACD is rising while in bullish territory, while daily Slow Stochastics are holding in overbought territory . It remains the case that a run towards triangle resistance near 92.75 may be in the car d s soon.\n\nAn Interesting Calendar\n\nComing out of the holiday week, and with European football semi-finals this week (today and tomorrow), various measures of volatility continue to decline. In this context, the economic calendar appears like an oasis this week: in what should be an otherwise quiet environment, data releases offer succor in the form of event risk volatility.\n\nThe June FOMC meeting minutes are first on the radar, followed by Chinese and Mexican inflation readings on Thursday that could ignite a spark in the commodity currency complex (AUD, CAD, NZD).\n\nDailyFX Economic Calendar, \u2018High\u2019 Rate Events, Next 48-hours (Table 1)\n\n--- Written by Christopher Vecchio, CFA, Senior Currency Strategist"}, {"headline": "DeFi vs CeFi: Where should you be earning yield?", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Finder", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://dvh1deh6tagwk.cloudfront.net/finder-au/wp-uploads/2021/07/defivscefi_finder_1800x1000.png", "author": ["Https", "Www.Finder.Com.Au Author Jamesedwards", "James Edwards", "Secure.Gravatar.Com Avatar", "Posted", "July Pm"], "body": "CeFi now offers highly competitive rates for cryptocurrency and fiat - how can you take advantage?\n\nEarning interest on assets you already own is perhaps the easiest way to grow your portfolio.\n\nThe risk is considerably lower than trading, and doesn't require fresh capital. Plus it puts lazy money to work.\n\nBut where is the best place to earn interest for cryptocurrency users?\n\nMost people think of DeFi as the only way of earning interest (ie, yield) on crypto assets. But there's a much easier and lower-risk alternative for earning interest: Centralized Finance (CeFi).\n\nBest of all? The rates can be just as good, if not better.\n\nCeFi vs DeFi lending rates\n\nTake a look at this table from DeFi Rate which tracks lending rates for leading CeFi platforms.\n\nThen compare that to the rates for three of the biggest DeFi protocols.\n\nThe CeFi lenders (BlockFi, Nexo and Celsius) all currently offer higher rates than their DeFi counterparts (Compound, AAVE and Yearn). They also offer the highest rates for many assets, which we've highlighted in green boxes.\n\nWhy the higher numbers? CeFi lenders use more traditional business models which allow them to offer more stable rates. They lend your funds out to individual borrowers and institutions with fixed repayment rates. That makes for a more predictable rate.\n\nConversely, DeFi protocols mainly use variable rates that are dictated by algorithms, which respond to changes in the market every few minutes.\n\nDeFi protocols also suffer from popularity\n\nWhen a protocol becomes popular, more lenders flock to it in order to earn yield. If the number of borrowers doesn't increase proportionally, then the interest rates for lenders go down.\n\nAs a centralised business, CeFi lenders can avoid this. They can prop up rates by sacrificing their own capital, or cap deposit amounts for individual lenders.\n\nFor instance, Celsius currently guarantees \"6.20% on 1st BTC, 3.51% after\".\n\nSo you don't just get potentially higher rates, but they are more stable, allowing you to forecast your returns and plan accordingly.\n\nCeFi isn't just eating up DeFi. Banks are also in the crosshairs. Just take a look at the rates offered on fiat deposits from Nexo.\n\nA 10% rate absolutely smashes anything conventional banks are offering these days. And unlike DeFi which is restricted to digital assets, CeFi providers accept your old-fashioned dollars, pounds and euros. Celsius is also offering 8.88% on AUD, CAD and HKD stablecoins.\n\nInsurance and risk\n\nAnother upside to using CeFi is insurance.\n\nAs a traditional business, CeFi platforms have more access to insurance options than their DeFi counterparts. Insurance policies vary between providers, ranging from comprehensive to \"nothing to see here\". Here are some example approaches from industry leaders:\n\nNexo: Digital assets are insured through a combination of specialist policies, up to a total of $375 million. Nexo plans to increase this amount to $1 billion by the end of 2021.\n\nDigital assets are insured through a combination of specialist policies, up to a total of $375 million. Nexo plans to increase this amount to $1 billion by the end of 2021. Celsius: Celsius doesn't guarantee insurance itself, but user assets are custodied with FireBlocks and PrimeTrust who have their own insurance policies. Details of those policies haven't been disclosed, however.\n\nBlockFi: BlockFi doesn't publicly disclose any sort of insurance policy.\n\nAnother key benefit of using CeFi is avoiding fees. You only need to transfer your assets once. DeFi protocols can require multiple transactions which can easily eat away at your profits.\n\nSo we've gone through the benefits, but what about the risks?\n\nSmart contract risk: CeFi lenders still utilise smart contracts which makes them vulnerable to many of the same risks as DeFi protocols. Some even use DeFi protocols to generate a portion of returns.\n\nCeFi lenders still utilise smart contracts which makes them vulnerable to many of the same risks as DeFi protocols. Some even use DeFi protocols to generate a portion of returns. Deposit limits: There is typically a deposit limit for high-interest rate products, with the rates decreasing once the limit is crossed.\n\nCentralisation: By using a CeFi platform you are trusting your cryptocurrency with a third party, rather than a smart contract which allows you to retain control over your private keys.\n\nEven with the risks in mind, CeFi offers a seriously attractive alternative to DeFi.\n\nRates are stable and competitive, risk is reduced, and the process is straightforward. There's no need to learn how to use dapps, or chase yield across multiple protocols.\n\nAn increasing number of exchanges such as Binance, Crypto.com and KuCoin now offer lending products, which makes it even easier to keep your finances in one place.\n\nCompare cryptocurrency lenders and start putting your money to work\n\nInterested in cryptocurrency?

With most US investors enjoying 4th of July holiday celebrations price action was muted as liquidity and volume were thin. The AUD bounced between 0.7510 and 0.7540 for much of the day unable to extend upward momentum and recoup losses suffered mid-June. Despite improving risk appetite and elevated commodity prices Investors appear reluctant in extending risk appetite gains. Uncertainty surrounding the Delta variant and global economic recovery have overcome the long run reflation narrative and continue to weigh on the AUD through the near-term. Our attentions today turn to the RBA policy update. Today\u2019s meeting has been billed as a tipping point, wherein policy makers will announce an amendment to the current stance on QE and monetary policy. Market consensus suggest the board will begin tapering bond purchase while maintaining the April 2024 yield curve target. A surprise announcement could spark price action and an interesting market response. A dovish narrative could sink the AUD and see the currency test lows below 0.7450.\n\nKey Movers\n\nFourth of July celebrations meant liquidity across major currencies remained thin through trade on Monday, prompting little price action and narrow ranges. The Euro, GBP, CAD and JPY all tracked sideways reluctant to extend moves outside a 0.2% plus/minus. The Euro did test a break back toward 1.19, touching intraday day highs at 1.1880 after service PMI data surpassed expectations. However, a dip in investor confidence saw the combined unit slip back toward 1.1850 before edging slightly higher into this morning\u2019s open. Our attentions turn now to the US ISM service PMI index. Having touched near record highs in May there is an expectation the index will correct lower in June, however as the US economic recovery gather pace a surprise to the upside is not out of the question. We are keenly attuned to the underlying indicators held within the dataset, particularly input costs. With inflation pressures growing a sustained uptick in through costs driven by supply constraints will likely mean transitory price pressures will remain in play through the near term.\n\nExpected Ranges\n\nAUD/USD: 0.7450 - 0.7630 \u25b2\n\n\n\nAUD/EUR: 0.6290 - 0.6410 \u25b2\n\n\n\nGBP/AUD: 1.8290 - 1.8550 \u25bc\n\n\n\nAUD/NZD: 1.0650 - 1.0770 \u25b2\n\n\n\nAUD/CAD: 0.9230 - 0.9350 \u25b2"}, {"headline": "Euro Shrugs Strong Investor Confidence, Markets in Subdued Holiday Trading", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Action Forex", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://www.actionforex.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/f-eur132.jpg", "author": [], "body": "Overall, the forex markets are relatively mixed today and trading will probably continue to be subdued with US on holiday.

Some volatility could finally be seen again, especially in Aussie, with RBA rate decision scheduled in the upcoming Asian session.\n\nTechnically, it looks like AUD/CAD has defended 0.9247 key support again. Further rebound tomorrow, subject to RBA\u2019s decision and statement, could pop the cross back towards 0.9394 resistance. Firm break there will complete a double bottoming pattern (0.9258, 0.9245), and turn near term outlook bullish. We\u2019ll see if that would happen.\n\nIn Europe, at the time of writing, FTSE is up 0.52%. DAX is up 0.05%. CAC is up 0.35%. Germany 10-year yield is up 0.0232 at -0.211. Earlier in Asia, Nikkei dropped -0.64%. Hong Kong HSI dropped -0.59%. China Shanghai SSE rose 0.44%. Singapore Strait Times rose 0.39%. Japan 10-year JGB yield dropped -0.0104 to 0.036.\n\nEurozone Sentix investor confidence rose to 29.8, but expectations dropped\n\nEurozone Sentix Investor Confidence rose to 29.8 in July, up from 28.1, but missed expectation of 30.2. Nonetheless, it\u2019s still the 5th increase in a row, and highest since February 2018. Current situation index rose from 21.3 to 29.8, 5th increase in a row, and highest since October 2018. Expectations index, however, dropped from 35.3 to 29.8, lowest since December 2020.\n\nSentix said, \u201cthe result is impressive\u201d but, \u201cwe are approaching a certain point of maximum momentum in the short term\u201d as expectations dropped. \u201cFor the economy as a whole, this is not yet a worrying decline. For the equity markets, on the other hand, which are very much focused on investor expectations, this development could contribute to increased market volatility.\u201d\n\nIt added, \u201cin this environment, the ECB remains in focus. So far, there is no sign of a turn away from the expansive monetary policy. However, the inflation barometer, which remains clearly in negative territory at -38.25, underscores the danger of further rising inflation rates in a globally increasingly synchronised, strong economic upswing.\u201d\n\nEurozone PMI composite reached 16-yr high, recovery stepped up a gear, but inflationary pressures ratcheted higher\n\nEurozone PMI Services was finalized at 58.3 in June, up from May\u2019s 55.2. PMI Composite was finalized at 59.5, up from May\u2019s 57.1. That\u2019s also the highest level in 15 years since June 2006. Looking at some member states, Ireland PMI composite dipped to 2 month low at 63.4. Spain hit 256-month high at 62.4. Germany hit 123-month high at 60.1. Italy reached 41-month high at 58.3. France also reached 41-month high at 57.4.\n\nChris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit said: \u201cEurope\u2019s economic recovery stepped up a gear in June, but inflationary pressures have also ratcheted higher\u2026 A wave of optimism that the worst of the pandemic is behind us has meanwhile propelled firms\u2019 expectations of growth to the highest for 21 years, boding well for the upturn to gain further strength in coming months.\n\n\u201cFirms are increasingly struggling to meet surging demand, however, in part due to labour supply shortages, meaning greater pricing power and underscoring how the recent rise in inflationary pressures is by no means confined to the manufacturing sector. Service sector companies are hiking their prices at the steepest pace for over 20 years as costs spike higher, accompanying a similar jump in manufacturing prices to signal a broad-based increase in inflationary pressures.\u201d\n\nUK PMI services finalized at 62.4, composite at 62.2\n\nUK PMI Services was finalized at 62.4 in June, down slightly from May\u2019s 62.9. That\u2019s still the second-highest reading since October 2013. PMI Composite dropped to 62.2, down from 62.9. That\u2019s also the second-highest reading since January 1998.\n\nTim Moore, Economics Director at IHS Markit: \u201cThe service sector recovery remained in full swing during June as looser pandemic restrictions released pent up demand for business and consumer services. Sales growth eased slightly from May\u2019s recent peak, but capacity constraints and staff shortages meant that many service providers struggled to keep up with new orders\u2026\n\n\u201cThe latest survey data highlighted survey-record rates of input cost and prices charged inflation across the service sector, reflecting higher commodity prices, transport shortages and staff wages. Imbalanced supply and demand was the main driver, while the roll-back of pandemic discounting by some service providers amplified the latest round of price hikes.\u201d\n\nBoJ upgraded economic assessment of 2 regions, downgraded 2, kept 5 unchanged\n\nIn the Regional Economic Report, BoJ upgraded economic assessment of 2 regions (Hokuriku and Kinki), downgraded 2 regions (Chugoku and Shikoku), and kept 5 regions unchanged (Hokkaido, Tohoku, Kanto-Koshinetse, Tokaiand Kyshu-Okinawa).\n\nIt added: \u201cwhile they reported that their economy had remained in a severe situation due to the impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) \u2014 with some reporting that it had seen a slowdown in the pace of its pick-up \u2014 many reported that it had picked up as a trend or had started to pick up.\u201d\n\nGovernor Haruhiko Kuroda told branch managers, \u201cJapan\u2019s economy remains in a severe state but is picking up as a trend\u2026 As the pandemic\u2019s impact gradually eases, the economy will recover thanks to increasing external demand, loose monetary policy and the effect of government stimulus measures.\u201d\n\nAustralia retail sales rose 0.4% mom in May, impacted by Victorian lockdown\n\nAustralia retail sales rose 0.4% mom, 7.7% yoy in May. That\u2019s an upward revision to preliminary result of 0.1% mom rise.\n\nBen James, Director of Quarterly Economy Wide Surveys, said: \u201cThe main themes from the Retail Trade Preliminary release remain relevant for the Final release. Retail turnover in May was impacted by the Victorian lockdown from May 28 onwards, as well as those states recovering from restrictions in April.\u201d\n\nAustralia AiG construction dropped to 55.5, facing capacity constraints\n\nAustralia AiG Performance of Construction dropped -2.8 pts to 55.5 in June. Current activity dropped -0.9 to 54.8. Employment dropped -6.1 to 58.3. New orders rose 0.9 to 56.1. Supplier deliveries dropped -8.5 to 50.9. Input prices rose 2.5 to 98.3. Selling prices rose 7.0 to 85.2. Average wages rose 5.4 to 70.4.\n\nAi Group Head of Policy, Peter Burn, said: \u201cAustralia\u2019s construction industry continued its run of strong growth in June but the pace of expansion is slipping as it faces capacity constraints and rising input prices.\u201d\n\nAlso released, building permits dropped -7.1% mom in May, versus expectation of -5.0% mom.\n\nChina Caixin PMI services dropped to 50.3, PMI composite dropped to 50.6\n\nChina Caixin PMI Services dropped to 50.3 in June, down from 55.1, well below expectation of 55.7. There were the softest increase in activity and new work for 14-months. Staff numbers fell as capacity pressured eased. Rates of input cost and output charge inflation slowed notably. PMI Composite dropped to 50.6, down from 53.8, worst in 14-month.\n\nWang Zhe, Senior Economist at Caixin Insight Group said: \u201cOverall, activity in both the manufacturing and services sector continued to expand. However, impacted by the resurgence of the virus in some regions in China, the services sector was weaker than the manufacturing sector, both in terms of market supply and demand or employment.\u201d\n\nEUR/USD Mid-Day Outlook\n\nDaily Pivots: (S1) 1.1823; (P) 1.1849; (R1) 1.1890; More\u2026\n\nOutlook in EUR/USD remains unchanged and intraday bias stays neutral first. Further fall is expected as long as 1.1974 resistance holds. Break of 1.1806 will resume the decline from 1.2265, as the third leg of the consolidation pattern from 1.2348, to 1.1703 support. On the upside, break of 1.1973 resistance will turn bias back to the upside for 1.2265 resistance.\n\nIn the bigger picture, rise from 1.0635 is seen as the third leg of the pattern from 1.0339 (2017 low). Further rally could be seen to cluster resistance at 1.2555 next, (38.2% retracement of 1.6039 to 1.0339 at 1.2516). This will remain the favored case as long as 1.1602 support holds. Reaction from 1.2555 should reveal underlying long term momentum in the pair. However sustained break of 1.1602 will argue that the rise from 1.0635 is over, and turn medium term outlook bearish again.\n\nEconomic Indicators Update"}, {"headline": "Midday round up: The focus moves to AUD/CAD [Video]", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "FXStreet", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://editorial.fxstreet.com/images/Markets/Currencies/Crosses/AUDCAD/forex-australia-and-canadian-currency-pair-with-calculator-4456331_Large.jpg", "author": [], "body": "Note: All information on this page is subject to change.

It\u2019s still a bit early to call a bearish reversal for the greenback. Yet, strong risk-on sentiments could cap Dollar\u2019s upside attempts ahead, and even trigger a deeper pull back.\n\nEuro ended as the second weakest, next to Aussie, but the late development in EUR/AUD suggests that the favor is not on Euro\u2019s side. More importantly, developments in some crosses like EUR/CHF and EUR/CAD indicates that market focuses might turn to selling in Euro in crosses ahead. On the other hand, the late rebound in Canadian Dollar opens up some upside prospects for the near term.\n\nNASDAQ closed at new record, heading to 15k handle\n\nNASDAQ\u2019s up trend continued last wee after some hesitation, and finished with a strong close at new record high of 14639.32. Near term outlook will remain bullish as long as 14439.90 supports. Next target is 61.8% projection of 10822.57 to 14175.11 from 13002.53 at 15074.39.\n\nThat would be an important level to overcome as it\u2019s firstly close to 15k handle. More importantly, a strong break of 15k could put weekly MACD back into a rising track. That would in turn argues that NASDAQ is back in medium term up side acceleration. Strong break of 15k would set the stage for even more powerful rise in this 2H of the year.\n\nDOW to catch to resume record run.\n\nDOW also made some notable progress even though it\u2019s still lagging behind S&P 500 and NASDAQ. Current development argues that consolidation pattern from 35091.56 has already completed at 33271.93, after brief breach of medium term channel support.\n\nDOW could take on 35091.56 record high this week, and break will confirm resumption of larger up trend from 18213.65. Next target would be 100% projection of 18213.65 to 2919935 from 26143.77 at 37129.47.\n\nDollar index failed to extend rally, but more upside still mildly in favor\n\nDollar\u2019s development was rather disappointing, as it reacted more to strong risk-on sentiments much more than the solid NFP report. It\u2019s still too early to call an end to the rise from 89.53 as long as 91.51 support holds. Further rally would still be seen to 93.43 resistance and possibly above.\n\nBut we\u2019d maintain that rise from 89.53 is seen as the third leg of the consolidation pattern from 89.20. Hence, we\u2019d expect strong resistance from 38.2% retracement of 102.99 to 89.20 at 94.46 at 94.46. to limit upside, at least to extend sideway trading. Break of 91.51 will suggest that such rise has completed prematurely, and bring retest of 89.20/53 support zone.\n\nEUR/CHF and EUR/CAD turn weaker, more downside ahead\n\nEuro turned notably weaker in some crosses last week. In particular, EUR/CHF\u2019s break of 1.0939 support argues that rebound from 1.0863 has completed at 1.0985 already. It\u2019s also kept below medium term channel resistance, and struggled to sustain above 55 day EMA. The development argues that choppy decline from 1.1149 is still in progress.\n\nDeeper fall is not in favor for the near term to retest 1.0863 support first. Break will resume the fall from 1.1149 to cluster support level at 1.0737, 61.8% retracement of 1.0505 to 1.1149 at 1.0751.\n\nEUR/CAD also dropped notably on Friday and deeper fall is now in favor this week to retest 1.4580 support. The failure to sustain above falling 55 day EMA keeps near term outlook bearish. Break of 1.14580 will confirm resumption of larger decline from 1.5978 and target 61.8% projection of 1.5783 to 1.4723 from 1.5191 at 1.4536. Firm break there could bring further downside acceleration to 1.4263 long term support next.\n\nCanadian Dollar has some upside prospect ahead\n\nOn the other hand, Canadian Dollar has the prospect of turning stronger, with help from persistently strong oil price, BoC tapering expectation. But that would be subject to the upcoming employment data this week. Anyway, AUD/CAD\u2019s breach of 0.9258 support argues that larger fall from 0.9991 is resuming. Focus is back on 0.9247 key cluster support level (38.2% retracement of 0.8058 to 0.9991 at 0.9253).\n\nSustained break of 0.9247/53 will bring some downside re-acceleration to 61.8% projection of 0.9757 to 0.9258 from 0.9394 at 0.9086. There is prospect of even deeper fall to 61.8% retracement of 0.8058 to 0.9991 at 0.8796. Strong rebound from current level, followed by break of 0.9394 resistance will suggest short term bottoming, and bring turn the fortune between Aussie and Loonie.\n\nAUD/USD Weekly Outlook\n\nAUD/USD edged lower to 0.7443 last week but quickly recovered again. Initial bias is turned neutral this week first. Another fall could still be seen, and break of 0.7443 will resume the whole corrective pattern from 0.8006. But we\u2019d expect strong support from 100% projection of 0.8006 to 0.7530 from 0.7890 at 0.7414 to bring rebound. On the upside, break of 0.7615 resistance will indicate short term bottoming, on bearish divergence condition in 4 hour MACD. Intraday bias will be turned back to the upside for 0.7890/8006 resistance zone.\n\nIn the bigger picture, rise from 0.5506 medium term bottom could either be the start of a long term up trend, or a corrective rise. Reactions to 0.8135 key resistance will reveal which case it is. Rejection by 0.8135 key resistance, followed by firm break of 0.7413 resistance turned support, will favors the latter case. Deeper decline would be seen to 38.2% retracement of 0.5506 to 0.8006 at 0.7051 first.\n\nIn the longer term picture, 0.5506 is a long term bottom, on bullish convergence condition in monthly MACD. Focus is now back on 0.8135 structural resistance. Decisive break there will raise the chance that rise from 0.5506 is an impulsive up trend. Next target should be 61.8% retracement at 0.8950 of 1.1079 to 0.5506 and above. Though, rejection by 0.8135 will keep the case of medium to long term sideway consolidation open."}, {"headline": "AUD/CAD May Be a Catch-Up Trade in Q3: Q3 Top Trading Opportunities", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "DailyFX", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "https://a.c-dn.net/b/0TRbKm/headline_Generic_1.jpg", "author": ["Justin Mcqueen"], "body": "Coming in to Q2 my trade of short AUD/CAD had been predicated on US exceptionalism and the growing divergence between the BoC and RBA. While the US exceptionalism narrative dissipated, the theme of diverging monetary policy continues to bear watching. The divergence emerged was after the BoC tapered QE, while also signalling a rate increase for H2 2022. In contrast RBA signalled no rate increase before 2024. In Q3 AUD/CAD may be a catch up trade with BoC tightening priced into the currency, while strong Aussie data (employment in particular) may see the RBA to bring forward rate hike expectations.\n\nMeanwhile my view is that USD will head higher from current levels. The consensus trade for arguably the past year has been to short the USD as evidenced by CFTC data showing the build-up in net short positions. However, the FOMC\u2019s hawkish pivot in which the dot plot projections now see two rate hikes in 2023 from zero, suggests that the central bank\u2019s reaction function has changed with FOMC less willing to allow the economy to run hot. Under these conditions, economic data will matter more and spur heightened volatility on data releases.\n\nOn the monetary policy front, the main dates to focus are the Jackson Hole Symposium (marks one year since the launch of AIT) and the September monetary policy meeting. Given the sizeable net short USD positioning, an unwind can provide fuel for a more prolonged rise as we head towards a Q3 taper signal. To add to this, an increase in \u201cdemise of the dollar\u201d reporting late in Q2 coincided with the greenback\u2019s low point, which could suggest that the pain trade would be for a more persistent rise in the USD.\n\nUSD Chart: Daily Time Frame"}, {"headline": "Asian Open: The US Dollar Sits Tall Ahead of Nonfarm Payrolls", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "City Index", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://www.cityindex.co.uk/~/media/research/global/news-analysis/featured-image/jobs-2.jpg", "author": ["Stonex Financial Ltd", "Matt Simpson"], "body": "Asian Futures:\n\nAustralia's ASX 200 futures flat (0%), the cash market is currently estimated to open at 7,265.60\n\nJapan's Nikkei 225 futures are up 120 points (0.42%), the cash market is currently estimated to open at 28,827.04\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng futures are up 18 points (0.06%), the cash market is currently estimated to open at 28,845.95\n\nUK and Europe:\n\nUK's FTSE 100 index rose 87.69 points (1.25%) to close at 7,125.16\n\nEurope's Euro STOXX 50 index rose 14.59 points (0.36%) to close at 4,078.89\n\nGermany's DAX index rose 72.77 points (0.47%) to close at 15,603.81\n\nFrance's CAC 40 index rose 45.99 points (0.71%) to close at 6,553.82\n\nThursday US Close:\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial rose 131.02 points (0.38%) to close at 34,633.53\n\nThe S&P 500 index rose 22.44 points (0.53%) to close at 4,319.94\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 index rose 5.252 points (0.04%) to close at 14,560.05\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn how to trade indices\n\n\n\n\n\nIndices: S&P hits record high for 6th straight day\n\nAnother day, another set of strong employment data and record highs for the US stock market.

That said, the employment component of the ISM manufacturing index contracted to 49.9 from 50.9. But, taken alongside strong ADP beating expectations earlier this week (even if softer than the prior read), it\u2019s not a bad set of data overall ahead of today\u2019s NFP report. But, as Matt Weller points out, some leading indicators point towards a weaker-than expected NFP today which could lead to another disappointment for the highly anticipated release (and take the wind out of sentiment just before the weekend).\n\nThe S&P 500 hit a record high for a sixth consecutive session and rose 0.5%, led by energy, utility and financial sectors.

If today\u2019s NFP data comes in strong enough it could reach 112.0 quite easily and possibly even 12.22. But, if it disappoints once again, we\u2019d expect prices to close firmly beneath the March 2020 high of 111.70 this week and roll over.

The broker must be an ideal match for your trading goals and approach. Not only your fund\u2019s security but also your success rate in trading depends on your broker to a great extent. So, it is crucial to carefully choose one among the many available in the forex market.\n\nTake a look at the best forex brokers of 2021 below.\n\nLeading UK Forex Brokers\n\nWhat is a Forex Broker?\n\nIn the foreign exchange market or vastly known as the forex market, the transactions primarily conduct between a pair of two independent currencies. In the course of buying and selling cryptocurrencies, a forex broker is typically a financial service company that acts as an intermediary between the trader and the interbank system. While making a transaction between a pair of currencies that are generally made of the ten most traded and liquid currencies including USD, EUR, AUD, and others, traders can initiate and execute a trade using a forex broker and earn profit depending on the current exchange rate.\n\nHow Do Forex Brokers Work?\n\nThe forex broker typically works as an intermediary between you and the interbank system, which is a network of banks that trade with each other daily. The broker will typically offer you a price from the banks and financial institutions through which they have access to forex liquidity.\n\nWhen you start trading with a forex broker and open your first trade, the broker will pass it through the market. They offer you a price for that particular forex pair, typically shown in quote form such as GBP/USD 1.3500/1.3505. Here, the first number is the rate the broker offers you if you want to sell the pair. The second number shows the rate at which you can buy the pair. The difference between the numbers i.e., .0005 or 5 pips is taken as a commission by the broker and is known as the spread.\n\nA broker will typically provide you with the best forex trading platform UK, which is a software program that can either be downloaded or used via a browser on the web.

In the course of buying and selling cryptocurrencies, a forex broker is typically a financial service company that acts as an intermediary between the trader and the interbank system. While making a transaction between a pair of currencies that are generally made of the ten most traded and liquid currencies including USD, EUR, AUD, and others, traders can initiate and execute a trade using a forex broker and earn profit depending on the current exchange rate.\n\nHow Do Forex Brokers Work?\n\nThe forex broker typically works as an intermediary between you and the interbank system, which is a network of banks that trade with each other daily. The broker will typically offer you a price from the banks and financial institutions through which they have access to forex liquidity.\n\nWhen you start trading with a forex broker and open your first trade, the broker will pass it through the market. They offer you a price for that particular forex pair, typically shown in quote form such as GBP/USD 1.3500/1.3505. Here, the first number is the rate the broker offers you if you want to sell the pair. The second number shows the rate at which you can buy the pair. The difference between the numbers i.e., .0005 or 5 pips is taken as a commission by the broker and is known as the spread.\n\nA broker will typically provide you with the best forex trading platform UK, which is a software program that can either be downloaded or used via a browser on the web. This is the main platform where you buy and sell currencies, monitor trades, conduct technical analysis, and all related functions of trading.

The broker should be regulated by a major international regulatory body.\n\nDo\u2019s and Don\u2019t\u2019s\n\nPicking the right forex broker will certainly nudge you in the right direction. However, success in the forex market also depends on your actions. You should thus know what to do and what not to do to minimise losses and maximise profits.\n\nDo:\n\nDevelop a concrete plan: You should always try to develop a concrete plan before you dive into the market. Evaluate your goals and objectives before you cast your first trade. Entering the market without a plan can have disastrous consequences, especially if one trades impulsively.\n\nAlways use stop loss and take profit: It\u2019s always important to sit down and evaluate the amount of profit that you feel is realistically achievable. This extends to the use of stop-loss and take-profit levels. Failure to choose fixed levels for closing your trading position will result in closing trades based on emotion.\n\nResearching the market: Staying on top of the factors that affect the forex market. This can extend to international politics, news regarding financial regulations, and other factors such as wars and natural disasters. Typically you would want to get real-time information on factors that affect the currency pair you\u2019re trading, such as the country\u2019s inflation rates and other economic markers.\n\nDon\u2019t:\n\nDon\u2019t commit money you can\u2019t afford to lose: There is a fine line between trading cautiously and outright gambling. So you should always stay within the budget parameters set. It is very easy to get carried away and end up investing more money than you originally planned in forex trading.\n\nDon\u2019t commit revenge trading: Revenge trading is when you try to make up for losses incurred earlier in the day by impulsively executing trades. Do not fall for this trap as you will end up trading using raw emotion rather than trading rules, leading to more losses. You should rather use take-profit levels to lock your gains once you reach your profit target levels. This will alleviate the temptation for further gains.\n\nDon\u2019t let emotions take over: Human emotions such as greed and fear can lead to impractical trading decisions where you will end up incurring a loss. For instance, fear can lead to traders closing their positions early missing out on profits. Always remember that you should stick to your set plan and exit the market once your target profit level for the day has been achieved.\n\nHow to Begin Trading with the Best Forex Trading Platform UK \u2013 eToro\n\n\n\nOnce you have made up your mind about which forex broker to use for trading your preferred forex pairs then all that is left to do is start trading.

It is also a matter of consideration to evaluate whether your trading style, preferred tools, and a chosen platform go hand-in-hand with the broker you have to opt for.\n\nTrade Now With Our Best UK Broker \u2013 eToro\n\nFAQs:"}, {"headline": "Exchange rates predict exchange rates: GBP/USD, USD/CAD, EUR/JPY", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "FXStreet", "date": "1 week ago", "image": "https://editorial.fxstreet.com/images/Markets/Currencies/Majors/GBPUSD/iStock-1088749732_Large.jpg", "author": [], "body": "GBP/USD Vs USD/CAD contained nearly a 2000 pip spread and nonnormal.

Going forward, the continued shift to a digitalized economy and growth in decentralized finance should only exacerbate this trend. Technology is an inflationary headwind unlikely to subside any time soon.\n\nMoney Creation, Quantitative Easing, Banking Lending & Interest Rates\n\nThere are two ways broad money supply is created; commercial banking lending and directly monetized government spending. I discussed the dynamics of money creation within my article on inflation in detail, and have again detailed this process as follows.\n\nHistorically, it has been the commercial banks that have been able to claim sole responsibility for the growth in the broad money supply. The notion that quantitative easing (QE) conducted by itself is money creation is false. The Federal Reserve and other central banks have the ability to influence the base money supply (M0), but not the broad money supply (M2). They can lend, but they cannot spend. Commercial banks create money via fractional reserve banking when lending occurs between said banks and consumers and businesses.\n\nQE is a means of capitalizing the banks, allowing them further scope to be able to lend against these freshly printed reserves with the central banks, whilst also pushing down interest rates in the hope this will spur an increase in lending. QE is effectively just a swap of government bonds for central bank reserves; unless lent against the two are negligible. Getting banks to lend is what increases the broad money supply.\n\nUnlike the Fed, the Federal government does have the power to spend. If the central banks and governments work together, they are able to rapidly increase the base money supply and the broad money supply. If the central banks are directly funding government spending and outright guaranteeing loans made by banks, then this is money creation and has no doubt played a role in the expansion of the broad money supply we have seen of late.\n\nIndeed, the shift of using monetary policy in isolation to monetary stimulus combined with fiscal stimulus will likely lead to a continued increase in the broad money supply. However, the misunderstood aspect of this dynamic is that ultra low interest rates and QE are in fact more likely to be deflationary, not inflationary. What\u2019s more, whilst the government is spending central bank financed money, the traditional means of broad money creation in the form of commercial bank lending is still non-existent.\n\nFocusing in on QE and interest rates, the primary goal of quantitative easing has been to lower interest rates to spur lending, create economic growth, increase asset prices and create a wealth effect. QE has succeeded in only two of these aspects; increasing asset prices and lowering interest rates. It is no secret QE has been by and large a failure.\n\nThe first problem associated with QE is suppressing interest rates to artificially low levels. Artificially low interest rates are not stimulative. In fact, there is evidence to suggest artificially low interest rates are only stimulative to a certain level, once they reach the ultra-low levels of today, these positive effects disappear to the point whereby they could be argued as being entirely deflationary. The below chart illustrates this dynamic well."}, {"headline": "Indian Morning Briefing: Asian Markets Mostly Lower as Covid, China Tech Action Weigh", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "", "date": "15 hours ago", "image": "https://www.morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "author": [], "body": "GLOBAL MARKETS DJIA 34577.37 -208.98 -0.60% Nasdaq 14663.64 24.32 0.17% S&P 500 4343.54 -8.80 -0.20% FTSE 100 7100.88 -64.03 -0.89% Nikkei Stock 28396.14 -247.07 -0.86% Hang Seng 27875.53 -197.33 -0.70% Kospi 3286.50 -18.71 -0.57% SGX Nifty* 15775.00 -66.00 -0.42% *July contract USD/JPY 110.51-52 -0.10% Range 110.67 110.40 EUR/USD 1.1821-24 0.00 Range 1.1828 1.1816 CBOT Wheat July $6.200 per bushel Spot Gold $1,798.05 0.1% Nymex Crude (NY) $73.73 -$1.43 U.S. STOCKS\n\nThe S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average fell Tuesday, retreating from last week's record highs.\n\nThe S&P slipped 8.80 points, or 0.2%, to 4343.54, halting its recent winning streak.

Investors were focusing on Covid-19 infection trends and any changes to ongoing containment measures in Tokyo.\n\nSouth Korea's Kospi was down 0.6% at 3284.38 in early trading, dragged by construction, travel and retail stocks. Risk-off sentiment was kicking in as growing concerns about the spread of the Covid-19 Delta variant in the country outweighed solid current account data and corporate earnings. USD/KRW rose 0.6% to 1,136.65, sapping investors' appetite for riskier assets such as equities. Index heavyweight Samsung Electronics fell 0.7% despite its above-consensus 2Q preliminary earnings release.\n\nHong Kong stocks fell in morning trade, extending a recent downtrend, as tech shares continued to weigh amid China's latest clampdown on the sector. The Hang Seng TECH Index was 1.4% lower, with Kuaishou lost 3.1% and Meituan was down 2.3%, while Alibaba Group and Tencent Holdings were 1.4% and 1.6% lower, respectively.

The HSI declined 0.9% to 27813.70, having fallen for six straight sessions.\n\nChinese stocks were mixed in morning trade, as the oil sector and software providers weighed while home-appliance makers rose. PetroChina fell 3.0% and Sinopec was 1.4% lower amid a deadlock among OPEC members that has created uncertainty over global crude production. Software companies Sangfor Technologies and iFlytek are 1.9% and 1.6% lower, respectively. Home-appliance makers are rising, with Midea Group 3.8% higher and Haier Smart Home adding 2.8% as analysts say sales appear to be improving.

Risk aversion was the theme but without a single catalyst as a culprit, NAB said. Data has been softer than expected, turmoil in oil markets and China's crackdown on publicly traded companies haven't helped either, while the fall in 10-year Treasury yields was an additional consideration, NAB said, adding that JPY and USD have benefited from a haven bid. USD/JPY fell 0.1% to 110.50, AUD/JPY dropped 0.2% to 82.72 and SGD/JPY edged 0.1% lower to 82.02.\n\nMETALS\n\nGold inched higher in early Asia trade, following a dip in U.S. treasury yields overnight and amid reports indicating that bullion purchases among central banks were gathering steam. Investor demand for the precious metal could rise, following a risk-off tone for equities, ANZ said. Spot gold was 0.1% higher at $1,798.05 an ounce.\n\nOIL SUMMARY\n\nOil rose in Asian trading, after declining overnight amid uncertainty over the outlook for global crude production due to the current OPEC deadlock. CBA said that while the disagreement between the UAE and Saudi Arabia may be an issue in coming OPEC+ meetings, both parties would likely find a resolution. \"We think OPEC+ will eventually agree to boost oil output for the remainder of the year,\" CBA said.

The sharp increase in tightening expectations that has taken place over the past week or so (OIS markets are pricing in a 25% probability of a rate hike by August at the time of writing, up from approximately 8% a week ago) however raises the question of whether the RBNZ will be actually able to meet the market\u2019s aggressive outlook.\u201d\n\nStrategists at Credit Suisse do not see a strong reason for the RBNZ to push back against the sharp recent hawkish repricing in RBNZ policy expectations at the 14 July rate decision, but nevertheless note that tactical risks have become very asymmetrical, and suspect that AUD/NZD might be vulnerable to spikes higher if the meeting outcome fails to properly validate market expectations. They continue to like fading AUD/NZD rallies to 1.08.\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

That fall had dragged AUD/USD from well over parity to under 0.75. The rebound initially helped the currency a bit but since 2018 AUD/USD is largely indifferent to commodity prices and follows rate differentials more closely, spending much of last year catching up with the effect of the Fed's move on those. This is now a challenge for AUD bulls, because the RBA seems committed to a strategy of keeping rates down until after the Fed has hiked.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis morning's policy meeting concluded with cautious economic optimism, a mini-tapering of asset purchases to AUD$4 B per week from September onwards (from AUD5 B now), and a suggestion rate hikes aren't likely before 2024.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don't think that the RBA can prevent AUD/USD from rising further if commodity prices remain high, and as the economy recovers from the latest round of lockdowns. But the currency will remain soft enough to ensure that Australia's current account surplus remains sizeable.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut no wonder that AUD bulls continued to migrate to the NZD. Not such an enticing balance of payments story, but at least the RBNZ is likely to react to recovery and housing inflation with (much) earlier rate hikes.

The pound remains firmer on the back of Boris Johnson\u2019s latest plans to remove lockdown restrictions on July 19th but a weaker dollar also helped support the pound.\n\nNZD/USD was the strongest major pair overnight and is less than 20 pips away from hitting our initial 0.7100 target and NZD/JPY rose to a 3-week high. AUD/NZD fell to a 24-day low ahead of the RBA meeting and EUR/NZD broke back beneath trend support for a second day in a row.\n\nThe New Zealand dollar was broadly higher after a strong business outlook report prompted two local banks to bring forward rate-hike expectations to November this year. The NZIER confidence index rose in Q2 to 7 form -13 in Q1 and is its first positive quarter since June 2017.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we take a step back on EUR/NZD, we can see it remains in an established downtrend on the daily chart, price action from the end of Feb appears to be corrective, and momentum has turned lower since failing to hold above its 200-day eMA. Barring particularly strong data from Europe today, it appears likely that EUR/NZD could close beneath trend support to strongly suggest momentum had realigned with its bearish trend. German industrial production, output manufacturing output are released at 07:00 and the ZEW economic sentiment report and eurozone retail sales is scheduled for 10:00. If they are weak on aggregate, it could help EUR/NZD extended its downside due to a divergent theme materialising.\n\nThe RBA kept their rates at 0.1%, not that they were expected to change anyway. But it does plan on a third round of bond buying which will remain at $4 billion per week until at least November. There was certainly no hawkish surprise in today\u2019s meeting, yet neither was it dovish relative to its usual standards of late. AUD/USD had risen to a five-day high on the back of a stronger NZD earlier in the session, yet has so far held onto gains since the meeting. However, RBA\u2019s Governor Dr Philip Lower is set to speak at 07:00 and that may prove to be the more volatile event as the RBA has generally kept forward guidance for public speaking events.\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn how to trade forex\n\n\n\n\n\nCommodities:\n\nGold rose to 1800 overnight thanks to a weaker US dollar. Momentum leading into the level is relatively strong, although several technical levels await ahead between 1804 and 1812 including the 200-day eMA, monthly pivot and weekly R1. So we would take note of any bearish reversal patterns around such levels. Silver is in a similar situation to gold, and its respective resistance levels are between 26.73 and 71.04.\n\nCopper futures rose to a near-three-week high, although we are waiting to see if it will now break above 4.4350 to suggest a resumption of its long-term bull trend or form a reversal pattern at or around that level. Also take note of trend resistance from the May high which could cap as resistance.\n\nOil prices continued to trade higher after OPEC+ members were unable to agree on the level of output. WTI rose over 2% and is on the cusp of testing its October 2018 peak, brent is up 0.95%.\n\n\n\n\n\nUp Next (Times in BST)\n\nYou can view all the scheduled events for today using our economic calendar, and keep up to date with the latest market news and analysis here.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to trade with City Index\n\nFollow these easy steps to start trading with City Index today:\n\nOpen a City Index account, or log-in if you\u2019re already a customer.

Beat your bank's rate by using a specialist FX provider: find out how.\n\n\u201cIn our view, much of the good news on strong domestic recoveries and monetary policy normalisation in Australia and New Zealand is now discounted, but the downside risks from the economic slowdown in China and its impact on commodity prices are underappreciated,\u201d Goltermann adds.\n\nThe RBA reduced slightly the amount of Australian government bonds the bank buys under its maiden quantitative easing programme from A$5bn to A$4bn and indicated that it might be willing to entertain the idea of an interest rate rise in 2024 or perhaps even before then.\n\nAnd the bank hadn\u2019t been expected to reduce the pace of the bond purchases quite so soon while only a handful of analysts and economists had dared to suggest that it might relax guidance relating to its 0.10% interest rate.\n\nHowever, there may be less scope for an interest rate rise any time soon if Goltermann is right about risks to Australia\u2019s growth outlook stemming from a possible slowdown in China.\n\n\u201cBoth Australia and New Zealand have close trade links to China, and their terms of trade depend a lot on commodity prices.\u201d\n\nChina is Australia\u2019s largest trade partner and the buyer of large shares of its commodity exports each year, which is notable in the context of an anticipated economic slowdown there and recently announced curbs on the production of steel; a key ingredient of which is Australian iron ore.\n\nIron ore exports are worth around 10% of Australian GDP, which is why the currency can often be sensitive to movements in prices of it.\n\n\u201cIt is increasingly evident that China\u2019s economy is slowing down. The latest round of data came in well below consensus, and we expect that trend to continue. This supports our forecast that commodity prices will fall back after their recent rally and suggests to us that the downside risks to the Aussie and Kiwi are growing,\u201d Goltermann warns.\n\nAbove: Capital Economics graph shows Australia's 'terms of trade' ratio and AUD/USD.\n\nThe Chinese economy saw a strong recovery in 2020 after getting a headstart in the coronavirus containment effort, which helped make the Australian Dollar one of the first to recover from losses seen at the onset of the pandemic.\n\nSince the turn of the year however, indicators of Chinese growth have begun to slow amid a gradual withdrawal of monetary and fiscal support provided earlier in the pandemic, although it\u2019s other policies like steel production curbs which matter most to the Aussie.\n\nThese the government says are designed to avoid overcapacity in the sector, to reduce pollution and move the economy onto a more sustainable growth path, although they\u2019re also a potential headwind for the Australian economy.\n\n\"The Australian economy is on a positive path. Output is now above its pre-pandemic level and more Australians have a job today than they did before the pandemic,\u201d says RBA Governor Philip Lowe at a press conference following Tuesday\u2019s policy decision.\n\nAbove: Pound-Australian Dollar rate shown at weekly intervals alongside AUD/USD.\n\nThe prospect of a Chinese slowdown and commodity price declines is all the more notable for the Aussie and potentially also for the Pound-to-Australian Dollar rate because the recently robust performance of the economy was a key motivator of Tuesday\u2019s RBA decision to adjust its policy settings.\n\nCapital Economics\u2019 current forecasts envisage AUD/USD spending the duration of this year and next oscillating around 0.78 before rising back to 0.80 in 2023, which are more conservative projections than those of many others out there in the market.\n\nThe consultancy sees the Pound-Australian Dollar rate spending much of this year and next around 1.79 before declining to 1.75 in 2023, although these projections would rise by default if Goltermann and the Capital Economics team were to downgrade their AUD/USD forecasts.\n\nChanges in the Pound-Australian Dollar rate always closely reflect the relative performance of AUD/USD and the main Sterling exchange rate GBP/USD."}, {"headline": "AUD/USD Price Forecast \u2013 Aussie Dollar Recovers Slightly on Wednesday", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "FX Empire", "date": "5 hours ago", "image": "https://responsive.fxempire.com/width/600/webp-lossy-70.q50/_fxempire_/2021/07/AUD-USD-3.jpg", "author": [], "body": "The Australian dollar rallied a bit during the course of the trading session on Wednesday to reach towards the 200 day EMA.

Worries that the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus could derail the global economic recovery continued weighing on investors sentiment. This, in turn, capped gains for the perceived riskier aussie.\n\nFollowing the previous day's sharp pullback of nearly 120 pips from the vicinity of the 0.7600 mark, the AUD/USD pair managed to gain some positive traction on Wednesday amid a subdued US dollar demand.

The pair reversed all gains and closed the day in negative territory.\n\nWhat happened in RBA?\n\nIn an accompanying statement, the RBA noted that the central bank\u2019s moves will provide continued fiscal support to the economy, as it needs meaningful support in the transition from recovery to growth.\n\nThe latest published macroeconomic data, according to the RBA, looks quite strong, but the risks of the uncertainty caused by the pandemic remain too strong to relax. This claim is supported by the facts: strict restrictive measures are now in place in Sydney due to the danger of a wider spread of the virus. Official data show that no more than 9% of the adult population is vaccinated, and this figure is one of the lowest rates among developed countries.\n\nNevertheless, the AUD reacted positively to the news about the continuation of stimulus \u2013 the RBA, apparently, will support the economy until it is fully on its feet.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for AUD/USD?\n\nThe Fed meeting minutes are due today in the NY session. But, first, we have to find the consensus of members on policy tightening in the light of the recent US labor market report.\n\nAUD/USD technical outlook: Key levels to watch\n\nThe price is trying to push upwards after a huge fall yesterday and close below the 20-period SMA on the 4-hour chart. However, the key is still a 20-period SMA. The pair needs to close above it to retain the bids. The last day fall on US ISM data came up with ultra-high volume followed by very low volume. It means that the sellers are taking profit that may lead the price upside.\n\nHowever, the daily chart is still extremely bearish. The price came back below the 200-day SMA with a widespread down bar. Any upside will be potentially capped by the 200-day SMA at 0.7540 area.\n\nLooking to trade forex now?

However, the aussie closed south of 0.7500 for a 1.5% swing, underlying the view of economists at OCBC Bank that the RBA shift is not likely to impart sustained AUD directionality.\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

While the Reserve Bank of Australia was not quite as dovish as people may have feared, the reality is that the market turn right back around during the European session to start selling off. We will eventually break down below the 0.75 handle to form a bit of a shooting star. The 200-day EMA sits just above, and it does continue to have at least some influence on the market.\n\nIf we break down below the bottom of the candlestick for the trading session on Tuesday, then it is possible that we could go looking towards the lows from last week, which would be a somewhat negative move. Breaking down below there opens up the possibility of a much bigger move, perhaps down to the 0.70 area, as it would be a very bearish look and could continue to see a bit of momentum based upon all of the air pockets underneath.\n\nTo the upside, we need to clear at the very least the highs from the last couple of weeks, which can be found at the 0.76 level. That is represented by a couple of shooting stars, so it is obvious there has been a bit of selling pressure in that area anyway. Breaking above there would be a very bullish sign, perhaps opening up the possibility of a move towards the 0.78 level above, which had been significant resistance previously.\n\nOne of the things that has had my attention over the last couple of days is the fact that the Services PMI figure in China for last month came in at 50.3, just barely above contraction. If the Chinese economy does in fact start to contract a bit, that would be very negative for Australia, which is highly dependent on exporting commodities to mainland China itself. Beyond that, we are seen a little bit of US dollar strength against multiple currencies, so it is not just here that we could see it play out. It is very likely that the market will continue to offer selling opportunities on short-term rallies at the very first signs of exhaustion.

(BTC/USD) continued to experience a series of lower highs early in today\u2019s Asian session as traders continue to react to the pair\u2019s ongoing consolidation. Traders recently encountered technical resistance around the 35951 level, representing a test of the 78.6% retracement of the recent depreciating range from 36675 to 32703.48. During the recent consolidation, bids emerged around the 33156.86 area, representing the 78.6% retracement of the appreciating range from 32703.48 to 35951. Stops were recently elected above strong selling pressure that was recently evident around the 35679.05 level.\n\nIf BTC/USD is able to resume its upward trajectory, traders will increasingly focus on areas that recently represented downside price objectives, including the 39444, 40847, 41322, and 44810 levels. Prior to the recent recovery, Stops were recently elected below a series of downside price objectives, including the 31676.16, 30950.63, and 30029.66 areas. Additional downside price objectives include 26980.02, 23052.90, and 22103.23 areas.

It is similar to all the traditional exchanges, and we think that it's still a misunderstanding in the market that people think Coinbase should trade along with bitcoin going forward,\" Lau said on Yahoo Finance Live moments after releasing a bullish research note on the company.\n\nLau reiterated his Outperform rating on Coinbase along with a 12-18 month price target of $440. In effect, Lau is looking for Coinbase shares to nearly double within an 18 month timespan.\n\nHere are key aspects to Lau's call:\n\nStronger than expected second quarter volumes.\n\nWall Street analysts will likely be forced to raise their 2021 estimates in light of a strong second quarter for volumes.\n\nConcerns of Coinbase cutting its fees are overblown and will subside.\n\nThat being said, Coinbase shares have been swept up into the downdraft in crypto prices going on for months already.\n\nFrom the record highs of more than $63,000 in mid-April, bitcoin (BTC-USD) has shed about 50% (including a trip below the $30,000 level). Major sell-offs have spread to other top cryptos such as dogecoin and ethereum amid fears of regulator crackdowns in the U.S. and China.\n\nCoinbase shares are down about 30% over the past three months. At $234.88, Coinbase shares trade well below the $328.88 level set on its Nasdaq debut in mid-April.\n\nCoinbase employee Daniel Huynh holds a celebratory bottle of champagne as he photographs outside the Nasdaq MarketSite, in New York's Times Square, Wednesday, April 14, 2021.

Coinbase indicated ~40% of its trading volume in 1Q came from altcoins, materially lower than peers (e.g., ~85% of spread revenue for Voyager). After adding Dogecoin, Polkadot, and others, Coinbase should gradually reduce its reliance on Bitcoin. We continue to see a sharp dislocation between Coinbase's fundamentals and its valuation and believe the current price offers an attractive entry point for long-term investors.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

Therefore, we expect BTC/USD to push lower again over the following 24 hours and reach the next support of around $31,000.\n\nCryptocurrency heat map. Source: Coin360\n\nThe overall market trades in the green over the last 24 hours, with Bitcoin increasing by 2 percent and Ethereum around 3.5 percent. Solana (SOL) and Polkadot (DOT) are among the best performers, with a 9-10 percent gain.\n\nBitcoin price movement in the last 24 hours\n\nBTC/USD traded in a range of $33,599 \u2013 $34,997, indicating a moderate amount of volatility over the last 24 hours. Trading volume has increased by 5 percent and totals $27 billion. Meanwhile, the total market cap trades around $651.6 billion, resulting in market dominance of 44 percent.\n\nBTC/USD 4-hour chart \u2013 BTC prepares to move lower again?\n\nOn the 4-hour chart, we can see the Bitcoin price retesting the $35,000 resistance as the market prepares for another push lower later today.\n\nThe overall market trades sideways over the past weeks. After both a higher high and lower low was set in the middle of June, BTC/USD started moving sideways again with the $35,000-$36,000 resistance tested several times.\n\nFrom the higher lows set over the past days, a trendline of support was established eventually, however, broken over the last 24 hours. This price action development indicates that Bitcoin price currently prepares to break down again and move to retest the previous significant swing low of around $29,000.\n\nAlternatively, if Bitcoin can push above $36,000 resistance, we can expect a lot more upside over the next weeks and a shift in the overall momentum back to the upside. However, the best option is to wait for further price action development in either a high thigh or lower low.\n\nBitcoin Price Analysis: Conclusion\n\nBitcoin price analysis is bearish for the upcoming days as the market has lost its momentum again, and a lower high was established overnight. Therefore, unless the $35,000 mark holds, we can expect BTC/USD to retrace lower today and start setting lower lows again.\n\nWhile waiting for Bitcoin to move lower, read our guides on DeFi advantages, Bitcoin fees as well as what you can do with Bitcoin.\n\nDisclaimer.

It currently sits at number 96 on CoinMarketCap (CMC) with a circulating market cap of $664m. Interestingly, the community is feeling slightly bullish with 70% of the votes on CMC siding towards an anticipated price increase. However, it should be taken with a pinch of salt, as there are no figures on how many people have voted.\n\nOMG/USD price movement over the last 48 hours\n\nOMG has started to climb back upwards again reclaiming key supports at $3.90 and $4.45 respectively. Furthermore, the moving averages (MAs) have once again shown a bullish signal with the shorter period MA crossing over the longer period MA.\n\nSince a lot of the smaller coins follow BTC, if BTC was to increase, it could be expected that OMG would be quick to follow. The main area of interest would be around $4.75 resistance where price tested that area three times before being rejected.\n\nIt can be expected that if the price were to reach that resistance again (accompanied by an increase in volume), it would soon break, and OMG would climb to the upside.\n\nsHKlQmxC.png (1793\u00d7809)\n\nOMG/USD price chart by TradingView\n\nOMG/USD 4-hour chart: Weakening momentum may lead to a collapse\n\nWhilst the shorter timeframe charts are bullish, the longer timeframe charts say the opposite. The 50 period MA and price both remain below the 200 period MA which provides an immediate bearish outlook.\n\nOMG is also conforming into an upwards wedge which historically has been a bearish price action signal. It signifies that buyers in the market are beginning to become exhausted, and sellers are starting to take control.\n\nFurthermore, the RSI indicator is also showing bearish divergence making lower highs while the price action fails to do the same. The important area of interest remains at $4.75 which, if tested, could ignite a powerful reversal back down and break the $4.45 support.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf this level does not hold, the next area of interest would be $4 where buyers have previously shown a desire to purchase in large quantities.\n\nsHKlQmxC.png (1793\u00d7809)\n\nOMG/USD price chart by TradingView\n\nConclusion\n\nSince OMG is a smaller coin it will follow BTC whichever way it moves. Therefore, if BTC starts to show signs of weakness, then OMG can be expected to break down and vice versa.\n\nIf BTC holds steady at its current levels, a short term increase can be expected with OMG testing its resistance near $4.75. The long term outlook for OMG remains bearish with two targets of $4.45 and $4 respectively."}, {"headline": "BTC/USD Forecast: Bitcoin Gives Back Early Gains on Tuesday", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "DailyForex.com", "date": "10 hours ago", "image": "https://dailyforex.com/files/stockphotos1/currencies/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/bitcoin_1539632267.jpg", "author": ["Christopher Lewis"], "body": "The Bitcoin market rallied during the trading session on Tuesday only to give back quite a bit of the gains and form a shooting star. The shooting star was also the candlestick that we formed on Monday, showing just how vulnerable Bitcoin seems to be at the moment. The 200-day EMA is sitting just above at the 36,500 level and going flat, so I think it is very likely that we at the very least stay sideways in the consolidation rectangle that I have marked on the chart.\n\nSpeaking of the rectangle, the $40,000 level above is significant resistance, while the $30,000 level underneath is significant support. With that in mind, I think what we have is an area that people are going to continue to go back and forth in, and ultimately, I think that the market is trying to figure out where to go next. Having said that, the market breaking down below the $30,000 level opens up the possibility of a move down to the $20,000 level based upon the \u201cmeasured move\u201d of the rectangle. Just as the market could drop down to the $20,000 level, if we break to the upside and above the $40,000 level then I believe it is likely that we will go looking towards the $50,000 level at that point.\n\nIt is going to be choppy regardless of what happens next, but it is worth noting that the most recent attempt to break down only produced a very sluggish bounce, and it looks to me like we still have quite a bit of bearish pressure that is more relevant in this market. I think that Bitcoin will continue to be very volatile on a short-term standpoint, but if we do break down below to the $20,000 level, I think there will be even more buyers underneath waiting to get involved in that general vicinity. We could enter a \u201ccrypto winter\u201d, meaning that the markets may stay very depressed for a longer timeframe. If that is going to be the case, then I will be accumulating Bitcoin underneath, in order to take advantage of value and ride the next wave higher.

So, it seems that there are still plenty of people who see it cheap close to $30k.\n\nThis was an OK call in the sense that $32,438 has continued to hold as a pivotal point.\n\nThe technical picture now is dominated by the narrowing consolidating triangle shown in the price chart below. Until the price gets established either above $35,600 (the current level of the upper trend line of the triangle) or below $32,438, the price is likely to continue ranging within this area, which could give opportunities to trade reversals within this area.\n\nI am somewhat discouraged over trading Bitcoin right now because the price has been going sideways within this rough price area for some time and is looking less and less likely to break out of it.\n\nI see the best approach today as to trade reversals from the extremes mentioned above. For bulls, it may be best to stand aside until the price gets established above $35,600 or even a little higher.\n\nRegarding the USD, there will be a release of the FOMC Meeting Minutes at 7pm London time."}, {"headline": "Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Forecast: Bitcoin Remains Range-Bound, Clinging to $34,000", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "DailyFX", "date": "15 hours ago", "image": "https://a.c-dn.net/b/3k4Cfm/headline_iStock-696301332.jpg", "author": ["Tammy Da Costa", "Markets Writer"], "body": "Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Forecast:\n\nBitcoin dances with Fibonacci support\n\nBTC/ USD range-bound despite regulatory concerns\n\nWhat will Q3 hold for major cryptocurrencies?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin (BTC/USD) has experienced a year of turbulent moves so far, driven by crowd psychology, fear and market sentiment.

indicates a higher peak in the current upward movement. Regardless, due to the imminent update of the unemployment rate, this will most likely be relevant for next week.\n\nOn July 9, 2021, Statistics Canada will report the unemployment rate. According to experts, unemployment in June was 7.7%, down from 8.2% the prior month.\n\nThe jobless rate is the total civilian labor force by the number of unemployed workers. It is a leading economic indicator for Canada. If the rate is rising, it indicates that the Canadian labor market is not expanding. As a result, a rise causes the Canadian economy to weaken. A decrease in the figure is positive (or bullish) for the CAD, whereas an increase is negative.\n\nThe CAD/JPY currency pair fluctuated between lower and higher values regularly. It marks the bullish flame at some point, despite tumbling down with a bearish light the other day. The currency pair CAD/JPY appears to be trading inside a strongly ascending wedge pattern. It shows that the market has a strong long-term positive tendency.\n\nConclusion\n\nGiven the pair\u2019s overall price movement over the last several days, buying the CAD/JPY pair at current levels could be a profitable short- to a medium-term trading decision."}, {"headline": "USD/JPY Price Forecast \u2013 US Dollar Choppy Against Yen", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "FX Empire", "date": "4 hours ago", "image": "https://responsive.fxempire.com/width/600/webp-lossy-70.q50/_fxempire_/2021/04/USDJPY-Chart.jpg", "author": [], "body": "The US dollar has gone back and forth during the course of the trading session on Wednesday, as we continue to hover around the \u00a5110.50 level. This is an area that has been short-term support previously, and therefore it makes sense that we are simply hanging around this area. Regardless, we are in an uptrend and therefore I think we need to look at this as a market that should eventually find buyers.\n\nUSD/JPY Video 08.07.21\n\nOne of the most obvious areas underneath would be the \u00a5110 level, because it is a large, round, psychologically significant figure and of course it also has the 50 day EMA approaching that at the same time. Furthermore, you can see that the market has been in a bit of an up trending channel, so that might be something worth paying attention to as well. All of that being said, if we break down below the \u00a5110 level, we probably have more of a deeper correction ahead.

Many, especially speculative and retail players, will think twice before re-entering the market from the long side.\n\nNZD/JPY is a case in point, surging after a very strong NZIER business survey and expectations of a possible RBNZ rate hike in November , before plunging. From 78.76 in late Asia/early London trading, it fell back to 77.30 before steadying. Central bank expectations should keep NZD relatively more buoyant and the NZD/JPY risk remains higher over the long run but most players will be wary of putting on fresh longs with the market so choppy.\n\nMXN/JPY has also fallen hard from its high perch, down from Friday's year high at 5.6230 to 5.5078 Tuesday. Resistance between 5.5527-5.6230, the range top between June 25 and Tuesday, should now prove strong.\n\nOther crosses that have fallen from higher roosts include CAD/JPY which fell from 90.11 to 88.46 and NOK/JPY which fell from 12.9934 to 12.6740 Tuesday.\n\nEUR/JPY, which has seen less volume of late, fell from 131.85 to 130.62 EBS Tuesday, and has pushed lower in Asia Wednesday to 130.50.

US equities notched fresh all-time-highs and US Dollar bears made their mark in the first two months of the quarter, with a notable pullback showing in June around the FOMC rate decision.\n\nBut, it was at that same rate decision that kickstarted a round of US Dollar strength that FOMC Chair, Jerome Powell, said that market participants should take the dot plot matrix and the Fed\u2019s forecasts with a grain of salt. That\u2019s what helped to really propel stocks, and risk assets, as it became clear once again that the world\u2019s largest national central bank is backstopping markets and apparently happy to continue doing so.\n\nThis does create some interesting dynamics elsewhere, however, such as around the Japanese Yen and the Canadian Dollar.\n\nThe Bank of Canada created some surprise in April when they became one of the first globalized central banks to start talking about post-pandemic policy. This led to a strong run of Canadian Dollar strength that was similarly supported by rising oil prices. The Bank of Japan, however, continues to hold negative rates as they have since 2016. And there appears to be little sign of anything changing on that front, even as a potential shift appears ahead of or around the Federal Reserve.\n\nThis has supported a strong trend in CAD/JPY that\u2019s propelled the pair up to fresh three-year-highs. And very nearby is an important watermark, plotted at 91.64 which is the current five-year high in the pair.\n\nCAD/JPY Monthly Price Chart\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; CADJPY on Tradingview\n\nCAD/JPY Bullish Breakout Potential\n\nA big technical item took place in CAD/JPY during the month of May when price action broke above a descending trendline that\u2019s connecting 2018 and 2014 swing highs. This also came along with a test above the psychological 90 level.\n\nThis keeps the door open for bullish breakout potential ahead of the Q3 open, and this can be followed by first looking for a test of the five-year-high plotted at 91.64, after which another interesting spot opens on the chart around 93.25. If buyers can push through here, then the 95.00 psychological level would be the next big spot to follow.\n\nCAD/JPY Weekly Price Chart\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; CADJPY on Tradingview\n\n--- Written by James Stanley, Senior Strategist for DailyFX.com\n\nContact and follow James on Twitter: @JStanleyFX"}, {"headline": "USD/CAD on the fence ahead of US jobs report", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "Forexlive", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://az705044.vo.msecnd.net/20210702/2-7-2021-6-40-34-pm.png", "author": [], "body": "The loonie is holding its ground in European trading\n\n\n\n\n\nUSD/CAD was up earlier to a high of 1.2449 but is now tracking lower to the lows for the day at 1.2418 as the loonie regains some momentum after a sluggish week against the dollar, despite higher oil prices in the lead up to the OPEC+ decision.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat may tell us quite a bit of how solid the dollar's performance has been and from a technical perspective, it has seen USD/CAD break above 1.2400 and even its 100-day moving average (red line) once again - after having briefly done so in June.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast month, the break against the latter technical level was short-lived as buyers failed to get close to contest the 1.2500 level and so the highs then @ 1.2481-87 offers a key resistance region going into the US jobs report later today.\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the hawkish tilt by the BOC, you'd have to figure that the latest bounce since mid-June owes much to a technical rejection of 1.2000 at its first attempt.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut if the BOC is going to play it slow now that the Fed itself is starting to turn the other cheek, then loonie gains may be less straightforward to come by than it was in the opening five months of the year.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we break back above 1.2500, I can see this heading towards the 200-day moving average (blue line) @ 1.2670 next.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat said, with the BOC likely to push forward with its agenda, the Canadian economy looking more optimistic, and oil prices to stay more upbeat, it is tough to fit the solid fundamental backdrop that is supporting the loonie at the moment.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs mentioned before, on the balance of things, I would argue that USD/CAD is likely headed towards another test of 1.2000 but that conviction isn't what it was pre-FOMC.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe technical element now is also part of the consideration, with dollar gains ahead of the payrolls later adding to the recent upside pressure in the pair.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs such, as mentioned before, there is a stronger argument that this latest shift in the landscape calls for a stronger loonie against the likes of the franc and yen in the long-term, given rate differentials and policy/economic divergence.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut of course, timing is everything so be wary of potential retracements considering how CAD/JPY was already the best performer in 1H 2021."}, {"headline": "CAD/JPY Increases Ahead of International Merchandise Trade Release", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://mlmhhbc485aw.i.optimole.com/ltER-78-JsCXf58R/w:auto/h:auto/q:90/https://fxdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/canadian-dollar-4511616_640.png", "author": ["Usman Ahmed"], "body": "Since the last three days, the Canadian dollar (CAD) has begun to recover against the Japanese yen (JPY).

(0.06%) from the hour prior. This move is a reversal from the hour prior, which saw price move down. Regarding the trend, note that the strongest trend exists on the 100 hour timeframe. The moving averages on the hourly timeframe suggest a bullishness in price, as the 20, 50, 100 and 200 are all in a bullish alignment \u2014 meaning the shorter durations are above the longer duration averages, implying a sound upward trend.\n\nCHFJPY End of Day Recap\n\nUpdated 00:30 GMT (04:30 EST)\n\nCHFJPY is down 71 pips (0.59%) since the previous day (opening today near 119.586), marking the 2nd day in a row a decline has happened. Relative to other instruments in the Forex asset class, CHFJPY ranked 31st the previous day in terms of percentage price change. Here is a price chart of CHFJPY.\n\nCHFJPY Technical Analysis\n\nNotably, CHFJPY is now close to its 20, 50, 100 and 200 day moving averages, which may act as price barrier for the asset. As for the alignment of the moving averages, well, it\u2019s a bit mixed up; the 20, 50, 100, and 200 do not progress from largest to smallest, or vice versa. The closest is the 100 day average, which is 39.1 pips away. Volatility for CHFJPY has been contracting over the past two weeks relative to volatility over the past month. Whether volatility reverts will be something to watch. The clearest trend exists on the 90 day timeframe, which shows price moving up over that time. It should be noted, though, that a trend in the opposite direction, going down, exists on the 30 day timeframe. Also of note is that on a 14 day basis price appears to be forming a base \u2014 which could the stage for it being a support/resistance level going forward. Or to simplify this another way, note that out of the past 10 days CHFJPY\u2019s price has gone up 5 them.\n\nThe View From Around the Web\n\nNot much commentary on CHFJPY that we\u2019re finding noteworthy here; guess people aren\u2019t watching this one :).

But with the labour force rising by just 151,000 and still more than three million below its pre-pandemic peak, we aren\u2019t entirely convinced that this is the start of a much stronger trend,\u201d says Andrew Hunter at independent research and consultancy Capital Economics.\n\n\u201cThe key event next week will be the release of the minutes from the Fed\u2019s June meeting, which are likely to provide more details of discussions about asset purchase tapering,\u201d Hunter adds.\n\nWednesday\u2019s minutes are set to hit the wires hard on the heels of June\u2019s non-farm payrolls report, which showed employment rising by almost 1 million last month and lifted the six-month rolling average of payrolls growth to a robust 481k.\n\nAbove: Pound-to-Dollar rate shown at daily intervals with Fibonacci retracements of Feb-to-June rally indicating support levels, alongside selected moving-averages.\n\nAchieve up to 3-5% more currency for your money transfers.

The calendar is quite light, with the highlight probably being the release of the FOMC minutes on Wednesday evening. Much focus will be given to how the doves and hawks are arguing their cases,\u201d Turner adds.\n\nThe Dollar ended last week on its back foot even after Friday\u2019s payrolls surprise, enabling the Pound-Dollar rate to rise back above a 1.38 handle that had appeared in danger of ceding and potentially indicating the directional bias of the U.S. currency ahead of this Wednesday\u2019s minutes, although it\u2019s the market\u2019s reading of and response to the minutes that will dictate how and where GBP/USD ends the week.\n\nThe risk is that Wednesday\u2019s meeting notes bring attention back to bear on the Fed\u2019s $120 billion per month quantitative easing (QE) programme and questions about what would be the most appropriate time to begin winding it down and the pace at which such an exercise should be carried out; potentially leading to increased bond yields and, or a bid for the Dollar in the latter half of the week.\n\nAbove: Pound-to-Dollar rate shown at daily intervals with Fibonacci retracements of correction from early June highs and key moving-averages indicating possible areas resistance to any recovery.\n\n\u201cThe US fiscal stimulus is by far the largest in G10, helping the US outgrow the rest of the world and likely supporting USD this year and possibly next. The Fed is on track to announce tapering at an upcoming meeting, and we continue to think the September meeting is most likely, with tapering starting at the turn of the year,\u201d says Michalis Rousakis, a strategist at BofA Global Research.\n\n\u201cOur key difference with the consensus is that we expect the USD to rally against currencies of central banks that will not be normalizing policies, including EUR, CHF, JPY and SEK, but not necessarily against the rest. Indeed, this is exactly how G10 FX has performed this year, with CAD, GBP, USD and NOK at the top, JPY, CHF, SEK and EUR at the bottom, and AUD and NZD in the middle,\u201d Rousakis adds.\n\nThe Dollar has been lifted in the last month by a lessening of bearish sentiments toward it which was brought about by evolving expectations for Fed policy, with investors and traders increasingly wagering that the bank could raise its interest rate before the end of next year, before lifting it back to 1% by the end of 2023 even as Chairman Jerome Powell poured cold water over other policymakers\u2019 suggestions that any changes to interest rates are in any way likely within this time period.\n\nAbove: Goldman Sachs graph showing market expectations for changes in major central bank policy rats (BoE in red).\n\n\u201cThere are still a number of open questions around the Fed\u2019s balance sheet, including the taper announcement timeline, the duration of the tapering process, and whether the committee will rule out rate hikes while the balance sheet is still growing,\u201d says Zach Pandl, co-head of global foreign exchange strategy at Goldman Sachs.\n\nProspects for U.S. interest rates have dominated the market conversation even as Chairman Powell and others made clear in June that the Fed\u2019s policy priority is the government bond buying programme and its eventual, gradual winding down, details of which may or may not be revealed by Wednesday\u2019s meeting minutes: To the extent that these do reveal anything about the likely timing of a decision by the Fed to reduce its footprint in the U.S. government bond market they will determine whether the Pound-Dollar rate holds onto or gives up the 1.38 handle ahead of Friday\u2019s GDP report.\n\n\u201cMinutes from the June 15-16 FOMC meeting, released on Wednesday, may help clarify Fed officials\u2019 views on the exit path.

The advance is expected to be limited given the overall lack of yield support with gains concentrated against the Euro, yen and Swiss franc.\n\nThe bank expects relatively narrow ranges will prevail in global exchange rates.\n\nUS Dollar Advance against Low-Yield Currencies\n\nBNP Paribas expects that a stronger global economy will be a key driver of exchange rates over the second half of 2021.\n\nAs far as the dollar is concerned, the bank expects that the Federal Reserve will take a measured step towards policy tightening, especially with strong US demand.\n\n\u201cAs the US recovery proceeds and the Fed gets closer to reducing policy accommodation, we expect US real yields to edge up.\u201d\n\nBNP expects that the increase in yields will provide an element of dollar support, but the absolute level of yields will remain relatively unattractive. In this environment, the dollar gains are likely to be concentrated against currencies where central banks will be even slower to tighten monetary policy.\n\nBNP looks at longer-term trends from economic cycles and notes that the dollar tends to strengthen ahead of Federal Reserve interest rate increases before weakening once rates actually increase.\n\n\u201cUSD gains are likely to be most pronounced versus currencies where the market cannot price a meaningful exit from easy monetary policy, notably the CHF, JPY and EUR.\u201d\n\nThe Euro to Dollar (EUR/USD) exchange rate is forecast to weaken to 1.1400 at the end of 2022.\n\nExport Earnings Boost Commodity Currencies\n\nAs the global economy tends to normalise, BNP expects there will be investor support for currencies where there are strong commodity earnings or interest rates are expected to increase.\n\n\u201cIn contrast, we expect a number of emerging market and G10 currencies with commodity exposure or where central banks are likely to hike in tandem with \u2013 or ahead of \u2013 the Fed to hold up well and even outperform the USD.\u201d\n\nIn this context, it expects that commodity currencies will maintain a firm tone and hold their own against the US currency.\n\nPound Sterling (GBP) Exchange Rates Remain Attractive\n\nBNP remains constructive surrounding the Pound Sterling outlook. The bank expects that there is scope for UK yields to increase further as the Bank of England is likely to be one of the early movers in removing policy accommodation.\n\n\u201cComparing the market pricing for rate hikes across the G10, the Bank of England looks conservatively priced, especially considering its less-restrictive forward guidance.\u201d\n\nUK assets continued to under-perform in the 2016-2020 period as Brexit uncertainty curb investor inflows. According to BNP, there is scope for a further catch-up effect over the next few months.\n\n\u201cWe also maintain our positive view on UK equities, as these have lagged the broader rotation into Value stocks, and this could benefit the GBP.\u201d\n\nThe Euro to Pound (EUR/GBP) exchange rate is forecast to weaken to 0.83 at the end of 2022.\n\nAbove: Table of currency forecasts from BNP Paribas covering period 2021-2022."}, {"headline": "Exchange rates predict exchange rates: USD/JPY and JPY cross pairs", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "FXStreet", "date": "1 week ago", "image": "https://editorial.fxstreet.com/images/Markets/Currencies/Majors/USDJPY/usdjpy_Large.jpg", "author": [], "body": "For the second instance over the past 4 weeks, all JPY cross pairs are at, near, or broke vital support points.
