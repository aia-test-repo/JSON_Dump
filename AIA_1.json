DXY Index) is at levels that would constitute its high close for July, just days after the \u2018goldilocks\u2019 June US nonfarm payrolls report.\n\nFalling US Treasury yields and US rate hike expectations draw into question the legitimacy of US Dollar strength.\n\nComing out of the US holiday weekend, and with European football semi-finals this week, various measures of volatility continue to decline.\n\nA Mixed Bag\n\nThe US yield curve is flattening. US equity markets are dipping. Some agricultural commodities are limit down. And with the US Dollar (via the DXY Index) at levels that would constitute its high close for the month despite USD/JPY rates falling back, it appears that markets are in a \u2018risk-off\u2019 mood following the \u2018goldilocks\u2019 June US nonfarm payrolls report and US holiday weekend.\n\nThere may be a good reason to suggest that it\u2019s the risk-off nature of markets pushing the US Dollar higher rather than some domestic-oriented factor: rate hike odds aren\u2019t following.\n\nWe can measure whether a rate hike is being priced-in using Eurodollar contracts by examining the difference in borrowing costs for commercial banks over a specific time horizon in the future. Chart 1 below showcases the difference in borrowing costs \u2013 the spread \u2013 for the July 2021 and December 2023 contracts, in order to gauge where interest rates are headed in the interim period between July 2021 and December 2023.\n\nEurodollar Futures Contract Spread (July 2021-December 2023): Daily Rate Chart (March to July 6, 2021) (Chart 1)\n\nAt their high last week after the June US nonfarm payrolls report, there were 107-bps worth of rate hikes discounted by December 2023; now, there are 92-bps priced-in. Markets are taking a less hawkish view of the FOMC; typically, this has corresponded with US Dollar weakness.\n\nVideo Technical Notes: DXY Index\n\nThe DXY Index is rebounding from familiar territory around the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the 2018 low/2020 high range and the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the 2011 low/2020 high range near 91.90. As a result, a bullish daily outside engulfing bar is forming.\n\nB ullish momentum is firming. The daily 5-EMA continues to serve as support with the entire daily EMA envelope aligned in bullish sequential order. Daily MACD is rising while in bullish territory, while daily Slow Stochastics are holding in overbought territory . It remains the case that a run towards triangle resistance near 92.75 may be in the car d s soon.\n\nAn Interesting Calendar\n\nComing out of the holiday week, and with European football semi-finals this week (today and tomorrow), various measures of volatility continue to decline. In this context, the economic calendar appears like an oasis this week: in what should be an otherwise quiet environment, data releases offer succor in the form of event risk volatility.\n\nThe June FOMC meeting minutes are first on the radar, followed by Chinese and Mexican inflation readings on Thursday that could ignite a spark in the commodity currency complex (AUD, CAD, NZD).\n\nDailyFX Economic Calendar, \u2018High\u2019 Rate Events, Next 48-hours (Table 1)\n\n--- Written by Christopher Vecchio, CFA, Senior Currency Strategist"}, {"headline": "All eyes on the RBA press conference; will it spark an AUD recovery?", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "FXStreet", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://editorial.fxstreet.com/images/Markets/Currencies/Majors/AUDUSD/hundred-bucks-3645622_Large.jpg", "author": [], "body": "AUD - Australian Dollar\n\nThe Australian dollar maintained a narrow handle through Monday in what was a relatively quiet start to the trading week. With most US investors enjoying 4th of July holiday celebrations price action was muted as liquidity and volume were thin. The AUD bounced between 0.7510 and 0.7540 for much of the day unable to extend upward momentum and recoup losses suffered mid-June. Despite improving risk appetite and elevated commodity prices Investors appear reluctant in extending risk appetite gains. Uncertainty surrounding the Delta variant and global economic recovery have overcome the long run reflation narrative and continue to weigh on the AUD through the near-term. Our attentions today turn to the RBA policy update. Today\u2019s meeting has been billed as a tipping point, wherein policy makers will announce an amendment to the current stance on QE and monetary policy. Market consensus suggest the board will begin tapering bond purchase while maintaining the April 2024 yield curve target. A surprise announcement could spark price action and an interesting market response. A dovish narrative could sink the AUD and see the currency test lows below 0.7450.\n\nKey Movers\n\nFourth of July celebrations meant liquidity across major currencies remained thin through trade on Monday, prompting little price action and narrow ranges. The Euro, GBP, CAD and JPY all tracked sideways reluctant to extend moves outside a 0.2% plus/minus. The Euro did test a break back toward 1.19, touching intraday day highs at 1.1880 after service PMI data surpassed expectations. However, a dip in investor confidence saw the combined unit slip back toward 1.1850 before edging slightly higher into this morning\u2019s open. Our attentions turn now to the US ISM service PMI index. Having touched near record highs in May there is an expectation the index will correct lower in June, however as the US economic recovery gather pace a surprise to the upside is not out of the question. We are keenly attuned to the underlying indicators held within the dataset, particularly input costs. With inflation pressures growing a sustained uptick in through costs driven by supply constraints will likely mean transitory price pressures will remain in play through the near term.\n\nExpected Ranges\n\nAUD/USD: 0.7450 - 0.7630 \u25b2\n\n\n\nAUD/EUR: 0.6290 - 0.6410 \u25b2\n\n\n\nGBP/AUD: 1.8290 - 1.8550 \u25bc\n\n\n\nAUD/NZD: 1.0650 - 1.0770 \u25b2\n\n\n\nAUD/CAD: 0.9230 - 0.9350 \u25b2"}, {"headline": "Euro Shrugs Strong Investor Confidence, Markets in Subdued Holiday Trading", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Action Forex", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "https://www.actionforex.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/f-eur132.jpg", "author": [], "body": "Overall, the forex markets are relatively mixed today and trading will probably continue to be subdued with US on holiday. Sterling is currently the stronger one, followed by Yen and Aussie. Canadian is the weakest, followed by Kiwi and then Swiss. Eurozone is mixed despite strong investor sentiment data. But all major pairs and crosses are staying inside Friday\u2019s range. Some volatility could finally be seen again, especially in Aussie, with RBA rate decision scheduled in the upcoming Asian session.\n\nTechnically, it looks like AUD/CAD has defended 0.9247 key support again. Further rebound tomorrow, subject to RBA\u2019s decision and statement, could pop the cross back towards 0.9394 resistance. Firm break there will complete a double bottoming pattern (0.9258, 0.9245), and turn near term outlook bullish. We\u2019ll see if that would happen.\n\nIn Europe, at the time of writing, FTSE is up 0.52%. DAX is up 0.05%. CAC is up 0.35%. Germany 10-year yield is up 0.0232 at -0.211. Earlier in Asia, Nikkei dropped -0.64%. Hong Kong HSI dropped -0.59%. China Shanghai SSE rose 0.44%. Singapore Strait Times rose 0.39%. Japan 10-year JGB yield dropped -0.0104 to 0.036.\n\nEurozone Sentix investor confidence rose to 29.8, but expectations dropped\n\nEurozone Sentix Investor Confidence rose to 29.8 in July, up from 28.1, but missed expectation of 30.2. Nonetheless, it\u2019s still the 5th increase in a row, and highest since February 2018. Current situation index rose from 21.3 to 29.8, 5th increase in a row, and highest since October 2018. Expectations index, however, dropped from 35.3 to 29.8, lowest since December 2020.\n\nSentix said, \u201cthe result is impressive\u201d but, \u201cwe are approaching a certain point of maximum momentum in the short term\u201d as expectations dropped. \u201cFor the economy as a whole, this is not yet a worrying decline. For the equity markets, on the other hand, which are very much focused on investor expectations, this development could contribute to increased market volatility.\u201d\n\nIt added, \u201cin this environment, the ECB remains in focus. So far, there is no sign of a turn away from the expansive monetary policy. However, the inflation barometer, which remains clearly in negative territory at -38.25, underscores the danger of further rising inflation rates in a globally increasingly synchronised, strong economic upswing.\u201d\n\nEurozone PMI composite reached 16-yr high, recovery stepped up a gear, but inflationary pressures ratcheted higher\n\nEurozone PMI Services was finalized at 58.3 in June, up from May\u2019s 55.2. PMI Composite was finalized at 59.5, up from May\u2019s 57.1. That\u2019s also the highest level in 15 years since June 2006. Looking at some member states, Ireland PMI composite dipped to 2 month low at 63.4. Spain hit 256-month high at 62.4. Germany hit 123-month high at 60.1. Italy reached 41-month high at 58.3. France also reached 41-month high at 57.4.\n\nChris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit said: \u201cEurope\u2019s economic recovery stepped up a gear in June, but inflationary pressures have also ratcheted higher\u2026 A wave of optimism that the worst of the pandemic is behind us has meanwhile propelled firms\u2019 expectations of growth to the highest for 21 years, boding well for the upturn to gain further strength in coming months.\n\n\u201cFirms are increasingly struggling to meet surging demand, however, in part due to labour supply shortages, meaning greater pricing power and underscoring how the recent rise in inflationary pressures is by no means confined to the manufacturing sector. Service sector companies are hiking their prices at the steepest pace for over 20 years as costs spike higher, accompanying a similar jump in manufacturing prices to signal a broad-based increase in inflationary pressures.\u201d\n\nUK PMI services finalized at 62.4, composite at 62.2\n\nUK PMI Services was finalized at 62.4 in June, down slightly from May\u2019s 62.9. That\u2019s still the second-highest reading since October 2013. PMI Composite dropped to 62.2, down from 62.9. That\u2019s also the second-highest reading since January 1998.\n\nTim Moore, Economics Director at IHS Markit: \u201cThe service sector recovery remained in full swing during June as looser pandemic restrictions released pent up demand for business and consumer services. Sales growth eased slightly from May\u2019s recent peak, but capacity constraints and staff shortages meant that many service providers struggled to keep up with new orders\u2026\n\n\u201cThe latest survey data highlighted survey-record rates of input cost and prices charged inflation across the service sector, reflecting higher commodity prices, transport shortages and staff wages. Imbalanced supply and demand was the main driver, while the roll-back of pandemic discounting by some service providers amplified the latest round of price hikes.\u201d\n\nBoJ upgraded economic assessment of 2 regions, downgraded 2, kept 5 unchanged\n\nIn the Regional Economic Report, BoJ upgraded economic assessment of 2 regions (Hokuriku and Kinki), downgraded 2 regions (Chugoku and Shikoku), and kept 5 regions unchanged (Hokkaido, Tohoku, Kanto-Koshinetse, Tokaiand Kyshu-Okinawa).\n\nIt added: \u201cwhile they reported that their economy had remained in a severe situation due to the impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) \u2014 with some reporting that it had seen a slowdown in the pace of its pick-up \u2014 many reported that it had picked up as a trend or had started to pick up.\u201d\n\nGovernor Haruhiko Kuroda told branch managers, \u201cJapan\u2019s economy remains in a severe state but is picking up as a trend\u2026 As the pandemic\u2019s impact gradually eases, the economy will recover thanks to increasing external demand, loose monetary policy and the effect of government stimulus measures.\u201d\n\nAustralia retail sales rose 0.4% mom in May, impacted by Victorian lockdown\n\nAustralia retail sales rose 0.4% mom, 7.7% yoy in May. That\u2019s an upward revision to preliminary result of 0.1% mom rise.\n\nBen James, Director of Quarterly Economy Wide Surveys, said: \u201cThe main themes from the Retail Trade Preliminary release remain relevant for the Final release. Retail turnover in May was impacted by the Victorian lockdown from May 28 onwards, as well as those states recovering from restrictions in April.\u201d\n\nAustralia AiG construction dropped to 55.5, facing capacity constraints\n\nAustralia AiG Performance of Construction dropped -2.8 pts to 55.5 in June. Current activity dropped -0.9 to 54.8. Employment dropped -6.1 to 58.3. New orders rose 0.9 to 56.1. Supplier deliveries dropped -8.5 to 50.9. Input prices rose 2.5 to 98.3. Selling prices rose 7.0 to 85.2. Average wages rose 5.4 to 70.4.\n\nAi Group Head of Policy, Peter Burn, said: \u201cAustralia\u2019s construction industry continued its run of strong growth in June but the pace of expansion is slipping as it faces capacity constraints and rising input prices.\u201d\n\nAlso released, building permits dropped -7.1% mom in May, versus expectation of -5.0% mom.\n\nChina Caixin PMI services dropped to 50.3, PMI composite dropped to 50.6\n\nChina Caixin PMI Services dropped to 50.3 in June, down from 55.1, well below expectation of 55.7. There were the softest increase in activity and new work for 14-months. Staff numbers fell as capacity pressured eased. Rates of input cost and output charge inflation slowed notably. PMI Composite dropped to 50.6, down from 53.8, worst in 14-month.\n\nWang Zhe, Senior Economist at Caixin Insight Group said: \u201cOverall, activity in both the manufacturing and services sector continued to expand. However, impacted by the resurgence of the virus in some regions in China, the services sector was weaker than the manufacturing sector, both in terms of market supply and demand or employment.\u201d\n\nEUR/USD Mid-Day Outlook\n\nDaily Pivots: (S1) 1.1823; (P) 1.1849; (R1) 1.1890; More\u2026\n\nOutlook in EUR/USD remains unchanged and intraday bias stays neutral first. Further fall is expected as long as 1.1974 resistance holds. Break of 1.1806 will resume the decline from 1.2265, as the third leg of the consolidation pattern from 1.2348, to 1.1703 support. On the upside, break of 1.1973 resistance will turn bias back to the upside for 1.2265 resistance.\n\nIn the bigger picture, rise from 1.0635 is seen as the third leg of the pattern from 1.0339 (2017 low). Further rally could be seen to cluster resistance at 1.2555 next, (38.2% retracement of 1.6039 to 1.0339 at 1.2516). This will remain the favored case as long as 1.1602 support holds. Reaction from 1.2555 should reveal underlying long term momentum in the pair. However sustained break of 1.1602 will argue that the rise from 1.0635 is over, and turn medium term outlook bearish again.\n\nEconomic Indicators Update"}, {"headline": "Midday round up: The focus moves to AUD/CAD [Video]", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "FXStreet", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "https://editorial.fxstreet.com/images/Markets/Currencies/Crosses/AUDCAD/forex-australia-and-canadian-currency-pair-with-calculator-4456331_Large.jpg", "author": [], "body": "Note: All information on this page is subject to change.

Unemployment rose to 5.9% from 5.8% but markets were seemingly happy to look beyond that as a blip.\n\nUS equities went into overdrive mode with the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 accelerating higher at their record high. After seven consecutive days of gains it is now the best run for the S&P 500 since 1997.\n\nThe ASX 200 is trading in a potential triangle formation on the daily chart. We said the same thing last week, only for price action to evolve, invalidate the pattern and begin forming a new one. Something that should be factored in here is the time of year, so this may well just be a seasonal thing as opposed to a build-up to a convincing break. The fact we have a bullish and bearish pinbar on consecutive days last week underscores its lack of direction, so perhaps trading intraday ranges may be the best play until we see a convincing breakout, one way or another.\n\n\n\n\n\nASX 200 Market Internals:\n\n\n\n\n\nASX 200: 7308.6 (0.59%), 02 July 2021\n\nConsumer Discretionary (1.3%) was the strongest sector and Information Technology (-0.11%) was the weakest\n\n9 out of the 11 sectors closed higher\n\n3 out of the 11 sectors outperformed the index\n\n128 (64.00%) stocks advanced, 61 (30.50%) stocks declined\n\n72.5% of stocks closed above their 200-day average\n\n66% of stocks closed above their 50-day average\n\n52.5% of stocks closed above their 20-day average\n\nOutperformers:\n\n+ 20.3% - IDP Education Ltd (IEL.AX)\n\n+ 5.16% - A2 Milk Company Ltd (A2M.AX)\n\n+ 5.00% - Nickel Mines Ltd (NIC.AX)\n\nUnderperformers:\n\n-5.28% - IPH Ltd (IPH.AX)\n\n-4.37% - Megaport Ltd (MP1.AX)\n\n-2.99% - Netwealth Group Ltd (NWL.AX)\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the Weekly COT Report (Commitment of Traders)\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Tuesday 29th July 2021:\n\nNet-short exposure to the US dollar was reduced by -6.6 billion dollars accord to calculations from IMM, meaning 11.1 billion of short exposure has been reduced over the past two weeks.\n\nTraders are their most bearish on Japanese yen futures since May 2019, with net-short exposure being increased by 16k contracts. Gross shorts were increased by 9.3k contracts and gross shorts reduced by 6.7k contracts.\n\nElsewhere, weekly volume changes were quite across FX majors.\n\nTraders were bearish on AUD futures for a sixth consecutive week.\n\nGold futures traders had their lowest net-long exposure in two years.\n\nCopper saw its first increase in net-long exposure in 8-weeks. Whilst by a relatively small amount, its 1-year Z-score is at -2.1 standard deviations, so perhaps there is a case to build for a trough to form on copper prices.\n\nPlatinum also saw a slight increase in net-long exposure, although 25k short contracts were cut \u2013 its largest weekly decline since November 2019.\n\nLong/short positioning (75% and above):\n\nCAD futures: 75.2%\n\nS&P 500 futures: 84.5%\n\nWTI futures: 82.4%\n\n\n\n\n\nForex: 50-week eMA continues to cap dollar gains\n\nThe US dollar index (DXY) closed back beneath its 50-week eMA after a false break above it on Thursday. The daily chart closed with a three-bar reversal pattern (Evening star reversal) thanks to a broad sell-off of the dollar after NFP. The trend remains bullish above 91.51 on the daily chart but it now appears likely to be within a corrective phase.\n\nUSD/JPY formed a long-legged Doji on the weekly chart and a bearish outside day on Friday. With traders increasingly net-short on JY futures we suspect new highs will be on the card once its corrective phase has been completed, but the March 2020 (pandemic) peak has proved a tough level to crack upon its first attempt.\n\nEUR/USD closed back above the June low after a false break, leaving a bullish hammer on the daily chart and suggesting a minor bounce could now be on the cards.\n\nOf all the reversal pattens across FX majors, commodity FX were the most impressive. USD/CAD was the biggest move, falling 0.95% whilst NZD/USD and AUD/USD rallied 0.89% and 0.75% respectively, and all had large outside days.\n\nAUD/USD closed above 0.7500, although take note of the monthly pivot at 7070 which makes a likely resistance level.\n\nAUD/CAD has held above the October 2020 low, so there\u2019s the potential for a corrective bounce form current levels as it has effectively been in a sideways range since early June.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhilst there are similarities between AUD and NZD charts, we\u2019d prefer NZD/USD for counter-trend longs over the near-term. AUD/NZD is drifting lower (which shows NZD is outperforming AUD) and NZD/USD has done a better job at standing up to dollar strength on recent weeks.\n\nNote the false break for NZD/USD of its April low in June, and prices held above that false break last week (unlike AUD). Therefore, our bias is bullish above Friday\u2019s low and would welcome any low-volatility dips within Friday\u2019s range as it may help increase potential reward to risk ratio for retest of the June 25th high. Still, it has to conquer the 200-day eMA so we could expect some notice around current levels, but the initial target is the weekly R1 pivot, just beneath 0.7100.\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn how to trade forex\n\n\n\n\n\nCommodities: Gold considers a break of 1800\n\nGold rallied for a third day and came close to testing 1800, closing the week with a (relatively small) bullish pinbar. With the dollar showing signs of a corrective phase, then perhaps we will see gold back above 1800. And there\u2019s also the fact that prices are holding above trendline support (projected from the May 2019 low) after a particularly bearish month in June \u2013 so a retracement could be expected from those factors alone. A break above 1800 is the next key level for bulls to break which opens-up a clear run for 1860.\n\nWTI trades around 75.25 ahead of today\u2019s OPEC+ meeting.

It\u2019s still a bit early to call a bearish reversal for the greenback. Yet, strong risk-on sentiments could cap Dollar\u2019s upside attempts ahead, and even trigger a deeper pull back.\n\nEuro ended as the second weakest, next to Aussie, but the late development in EUR/AUD suggests that the favor is not on Euro\u2019s side. More importantly, developments in some crosses like EUR/CHF and EUR/CAD indicates that market focuses might turn to selling in Euro in crosses ahead. On the other hand, the late rebound in Canadian Dollar opens up some upside prospects for the near term.\n\nNASDAQ closed at new record, heading to 15k handle\n\nNASDAQ\u2019s up trend continued last wee after some hesitation, and finished with a strong close at new record high of 14639.32. Near term outlook will remain bullish as long as 14439.90 supports. Next target is 61.8% projection of 10822.57 to 14175.11 from 13002.53 at 15074.39.\n\nThat would be an important level to overcome as it\u2019s firstly close to 15k handle. More importantly, a strong break of 15k could put weekly MACD back into a rising track. That would in turn argues that NASDAQ is back in medium term up side acceleration. Strong break of 15k would set the stage for even more powerful rise in this 2H of the year.\n\nDOW to catch to resume record run.\n\nDOW also made some notable progress even though it\u2019s still lagging behind S&P 500 and NASDAQ. Current development argues that consolidation pattern from 35091.56 has already completed at 33271.93, after brief breach of medium term channel support.\n\nDOW could take on 35091.56 record high this week, and break will confirm resumption of larger up trend from 18213.65. Next target would be 100% projection of 18213.65 to 2919935 from 26143.77 at 37129.47.\n\nDollar index failed to extend rally, but more upside still mildly in favor\n\nDollar\u2019s development was rather disappointing, as it reacted more to strong risk-on sentiments much more than the solid NFP report. It\u2019s still too early to call an end to the rise from 89.53 as long as 91.51 support holds. Further rally would still be seen to 93.43 resistance and possibly above.\n\nBut we\u2019d maintain that rise from 89.53 is seen as the third leg of the consolidation pattern from 89.20. Hence, we\u2019d expect strong resistance from 38.2% retracement of 102.99 to 89.20 at 94.46 at 94.46. to limit upside, at least to extend sideway trading. Break of 91.51 will suggest that such rise has completed prematurely, and bring retest of 89.20/53 support zone.\n\nEUR/CHF and EUR/CAD turn weaker, more downside ahead\n\nEuro turned notably weaker in some crosses last week. In particular, EUR/CHF\u2019s break of 1.0939 support argues that rebound from 1.0863 has completed at 1.0985 already. It\u2019s also kept below medium term channel resistance, and struggled to sustain above 55 day EMA. The development argues that choppy decline from 1.1149 is still in progress.\n\nDeeper fall is not in favor for the near term to retest 1.0863 support first. Break will resume the fall from 1.1149 to cluster support level at 1.0737, 61.8% retracement of 1.0505 to 1.1149 at 1.0751.\n\nEUR/CAD also dropped notably on Friday and deeper fall is now in favor this week to retest 1.4580 support. The failure to sustain above falling 55 day EMA keeps near term outlook bearish. Break of 1.14580 will confirm resumption of larger decline from 1.5978 and target 61.8% projection of 1.5783 to 1.4723 from 1.5191 at 1.4536. Firm break there could bring further downside acceleration to 1.4263 long term support next.\n\nCanadian Dollar has some upside prospect ahead\n\nOn the other hand, Canadian Dollar has the prospect of turning stronger, with help from persistently strong oil price, BoC tapering expectation. But that would be subject to the upcoming employment data this week. Anyway, AUD/CAD\u2019s breach of 0.9258 support argues that larger fall from 0.9991 is resuming. Focus is back on 0.9247 key cluster support level (38.2% retracement of 0.8058 to 0.9991 at 0.9253).\n\nSustained break of 0.9247/53 will bring some downside re-acceleration to 61.8% projection of 0.9757 to 0.9258 from 0.9394 at 0.9086. There is prospect of even deeper fall to 61.8% retracement of 0.8058 to 0.9991 at 0.8796. Strong rebound from current level, followed by break of 0.9394 resistance will suggest short term bottoming, and bring turn the fortune between Aussie and Loonie.\n\nAUD/USD Weekly Outlook\n\nAUD/USD edged lower to 0.7443 last week but quickly recovered again. Initial bias is turned neutral this week first. Another fall could still be seen, and break of 0.7443 will resume the whole corrective pattern from 0.8006. But we\u2019d expect strong support from 100% projection of 0.8006 to 0.7530 from 0.7890 at 0.7414 to bring rebound. On the upside, break of 0.7615 resistance will indicate short term bottoming, on bearish divergence condition in 4 hour MACD. Intraday bias will be turned back to the upside for 0.7890/8006 resistance zone.\n\nIn the bigger picture, rise from 0.5506 medium term bottom could either be the start of a long term up trend, or a corrective rise. Reactions to 0.8135 key resistance will reveal which case it is. Rejection by 0.8135 key resistance, followed by firm break of 0.7413 resistance turned support, will favors the latter case. Deeper decline would be seen to 38.2% retracement of 0.5506 to 0.8006 at 0.7051 first.\n\nIn the longer term picture, 0.5506 is a long term bottom, on bullish convergence condition in monthly MACD. Focus is now back on 0.8135 structural resistance. Decisive break there will raise the chance that rise from 0.5506 is an impulsive up trend. Next target should be 61.8% retracement at 0.8950 of 1.1079 to 0.5506 and above. Though, rejection by 0.8135 will keep the case of medium to long term sideway consolidation open."}, {"headline": "AUD/CAD May Be a Catch-Up Trade in Q3: Q3 Top Trading Opportunities", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "DailyFX", "date": "6 days ago", "image": "https://a.c-dn.net/b/0TRbKm/headline_Generic_1.jpg", "author": ["Justin Mcqueen"], "body": "Coming in to Q2 my trade of short AUD/CAD had been predicated on US exceptionalism and the growing divergence between the BoC and RBA. While the US exceptionalism narrative dissipated, the theme of diverging monetary policy continues to bear watching. The divergence emerged was after the BoC tapered QE, while also signalling a rate increase for H2 2022. In contrast RBA signalled no rate increase before 2024. In Q3 AUD/CAD may be a catch up trade with BoC tightening priced into the currency, while strong Aussie data (employment in particular) may see the RBA to bring forward rate hike expectations.\n\nMeanwhile my view is that USD will head higher from current levels. The consensus trade for arguably the past year has been to short the USD as evidenced by CFTC data showing the build-up in net short positions. However, the FOMC\u2019s hawkish pivot in which the dot plot projections now see two rate hikes in 2023 from zero, suggests that the central bank\u2019s reaction function has changed with FOMC less willing to allow the economy to run hot. Under these conditions, economic data will matter more and spur heightened volatility on data releases.\n\nOn the monetary policy front, the main dates to focus are the Jackson Hole Symposium (marks one year since the launch of AIT) and the September monetary policy meeting. Given the sizeable net short USD positioning, an unwind can provide fuel for a more prolonged rise as we head towards a Q3 taper signal. To add to this, an increase in \u201cdemise of the dollar\u201d reporting late in Q2 coincided with the greenback\u2019s low point, which could suggest that the pain trade would be for a more persistent rise in the USD.\n\nUSD Chart: Daily Time Frame"}, {"headline": "The CAD is the strongest and the EUR is the weakest as the NA session begins", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Forexlive", "date": "1 week ago", "image": "https://az705044.vo.msecnd.net/20210702/2021-07-02_4-48-45.jpg", "author": [], "body": "The USD is mixed ahead of the key US employment report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow are the changes in the value of the USD vs the majors to start the NY session.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn other markets at the start of the session: Looking at the volatility going into the North American session, there are 4 of 7 that have ranges less than 50% of the norm over the last 22 trading days including the GBP with only a 39 pip trading range (vs 93 pips, 42% of what is normal).

However, for the medium term we would not throw in the towel on EUR appreciation just yet. The currency tends to perform very well in periods of cyclical growth upswings, similar to the one currently underway. EURCHF is likely to reach 1.12 by the end of the year, in our view.\n\nTurning to sterling, we maintain a neutral stance. We still expect structural Brexit-related headwinds to keep pressure on the GBP. The main risk to this view is an earlier tightening of monetary policy by the Bank of England.\n\nWe have raised our USDJPY forecasts, as the hawkish Fed and sizeable outward Japanese M&A activity will weigh on the yen for the time being.\n\nFor EM currencies \u2026we are likely entering a more challenging period. Caution is warranted for EMFX exposure\n\nThe Nordics are likely to sustain losses in the short term, but growth rotation towards Europe should allow appreciation in H2 21. A similar pattern should occur in the core commodity FX G10 bloc (AUD, CAD, and NZD), which should find some support further out on rising commodity prices. For emerging market currencies, while conditions had been supportive given stable US real yields and positive EM data surprises, we are likely entering a more challenging period. Accordingly, caution is warranted for EMFX exposure, but we continue to favour the RMB as our top pick (see FX ISB - Stress-testing our constructive renminbi view).\n\nIn terms of the EMFX path ahead, we believe the 2013 \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d playbook may not work given better global trade growth and commodity price momentum in 2021 as well as improved EM external balances. However, in recent years, we do find a number of currencies that are more sensitive to US yields. These include the TRY and HUF (CEEMEA), IDR and INR (Asia), and CLP and COP (LatAm).\n\nMain risks to our view: The main upside risk to our forecasts comes from a stronger recovery in global trade that could support bigger and broader rallies in the G10 and emerging markets. On the downside, we see the following risks: First, further rapid increases in US yields (a US \u201cyield tantrum\u201d). Second, the Fed gradually turning more hawkish.

The broker should be regulated by a major international regulatory body.\n\nDo\u2019s and Don\u2019t\u2019s\n\nPicking the right forex broker will certainly nudge you in the right direction. However, success in the forex market also depends on your actions. You should thus know what to do and what not to do to minimise losses and maximise profits.\n\nDo:\n\nDevelop a concrete plan: You should always try to develop a concrete plan before you dive into the market. Evaluate your goals and objectives before you cast your first trade. Entering the market without a plan can have disastrous consequences, especially if one trades impulsively.\n\nAlways use stop loss and take profit: It\u2019s always important to sit down and evaluate the amount of profit that you feel is realistically achievable. This extends to the use of stop-loss and take-profit levels. Failure to choose fixed levels for closing your trading position will result in closing trades based on emotion.\n\nResearching the market: Staying on top of the factors that affect the forex market. This can extend to international politics, news regarding financial regulations, and other factors such as wars and natural disasters. Typically you would want to get real-time information on factors that affect the currency pair you\u2019re trading, such as the country\u2019s inflation rates and other economic markers.\n\nDon\u2019t:\n\nDon\u2019t commit money you can\u2019t afford to lose: There is a fine line between trading cautiously and outright gambling. So you should always stay within the budget parameters set. It is very easy to get carried away and end up investing more money than you originally planned in forex trading.\n\nDon\u2019t commit revenge trading: Revenge trading is when you try to make up for losses incurred earlier in the day by impulsively executing trades. Do not fall for this trap as you will end up trading using raw emotion rather than trading rules, leading to more losses. You should rather use take-profit levels to lock your gains once you reach your profit target levels. This will alleviate the temptation for further gains.\n\nDon\u2019t let emotions take over: Human emotions such as greed and fear can lead to impractical trading decisions where you will end up incurring a loss. For instance, fear can lead to traders closing their positions early missing out on profits. Always remember that you should stick to your set plan and exit the market once your target profit level for the day has been achieved.\n\nHow to Begin Trading with the Best Forex Trading Platform UK \u2013 eToro\n\n\n\nOnce you have made up your mind about which forex broker to use for trading your preferred forex pairs then all that is left to do is start trading. People with some experience might not get stuck at this point but those individuals who have never tried opening an account with a high-quality forex broker would find it complex.\n\nThe following step-by-guide is supposed to help the latter by explaining the procedure of getting started with the best forex broker.\n\nStep 1: Visit eToro\n\n\n\nAfter you have decided which forex broker to proceed with, the first thing to do is visit their official website and get accustomed to it. There you will find a lot of important information regarding their trading platform, its features, its offerings, and most importantly where to join.

Once you get a confirmation as an email, click on the link provided and it would guide you to a secure server where you can make an initial deposit required to start trading. Simply choose a payment option and select a sufficient amount.\n\nStep 4: Start Trading Forex\n\nWhen your trading account has acquired funds, you are ready to trade any forex pair you like. To do that, choose a buy/sell order, enter the amount you wish to stake, set up an order type such as stop-loss (if possible), click confirm to place the order.\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nThe importance of a retail forex broker in the FX market is crucial from opening a trading account to executing your first trade. It is also a matter of consideration to evaluate whether your trading style, preferred tools, and a chosen platform go hand-in-hand with the broker you have to opt for.\n\nTrade Now With Our Best UK

The FTSE 100 managed to close just above 7,000 after a brief spell beneath it, ad closed below its 50-day eMA for the first time since February. With futures markets pointing lower is suggests a weaker open for cash indices so, unless we see any signs of risk appetite emerging traders may favour selling into minor rallies if they occur. A break above 7075 today invalidates that bias.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn yesterday\u2019s report we noted that the STOXX 50 had drifted towards a key support zone and that we were waiting for \u201cmomentum to tip its hand\u201d. Well, the clear break beneath 4020 support certainly did just that, so we have now switched to a bearish bias. Although the caveat ties in with today\u2019s video, in that we are yet to see if the holding patterns seen across Asian trade is a pause in breath before further losses, or the beginnings of a sympathy bounce. Therefore, traders would be wise to keep an eye on AUD/JPY and yields to assess which way equities will break today.\n\nYesterday\u2019s low respected the lower trendline of its bearish channel, so if we see prices ounce then 4020-4040 is a key resistance zone today for bears to consider fading into (prior support, 200-hour eMA, weekly S2 and monthly S1 pivots).\n\n\n\n\n\nFTSE 350: Market Internals\n\n\n\n\n\nFTSE 350: 4035.66 (-1.68%) 08 July 2021\n\n27 (7.69%) stocks advanced and 317 (90.31%) declined\n\n18 stocks rose to a new 52-week high, 4 fell to new lows\n\n81.2% of stocks closed above their 200-day average\n\n19.09% of stocks closed above their 20-day average\n\nOutperformers:\n\n+ 2.20% - Auction Technology Group PLC (ATG.L)\n\n+ 1.33% - Easyjet PLC (EZJ.L)\n\n+ 1.27% - Cairn Energy PLC (CNE.L)\n\nUnderperformers:\n\n-6.01% - Restaurant Group PLC (RTN.L)\n\n-5.40% - Trainline PLC (TRNT.L)\n\n-5.05% - Intermediate Capital Group PLC (ICP.L)\n\n\n\n\n\nForex:\n\nGBP pairs will be in focus around a host of UK data points around 07:00 BST. Q2 data showed a record rise of 27.6% as lockdown measures were eased, and today\u2019s monthly growth estimates are likely to signal a cooldown of the breakneck speed. Industrial and manufacturing output and trade data are also released, so it could be a volatile hour should data come in heavily skewed above or below expectations.\n\nGBP/CHF probed the May low during its most bearish session since September 2020 yesterday. Whilst it closed just above it, prices are consolidating into a potential bear flag formation ahead of UK\u2019s data. So a strong data set could see a bounce from current levels, or send it back beneath 1.2583 should it disappoint enough. GBP/JPY is in a similar position and sat on the June low of 151.29 and bears may be tempted to fade into rallies up to 152.29 resistance.\n\nCanada will release their employment data at 13:30 BST, and an improvement is expected due to the summer hiring boom. Unemployment is estimated to fall to 7.7% from 8.2% and 195k jobs are forecast to be added and make up for the disappointing -68k read in May.\n\nEUR/CAD broke above a two-month range yesterday and is now trying to build a base above the 1.4820 breakout level, making it a pivotal level for today\u2019s session. USD/CAD is building a decent bullish trend on the hourly chart, but take note of yesterday\u2019s high as it respected the monthly R1 pivot level, so a strong employment report could mark it as the high for the week.\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn how to trade forex\n\n\n\n\n\nCommodities:\n\nThere wasn\u2019t a great deal of movement from commodity markets overnight, although relative to equity and currency markets they mostly escaped the mayhem of yesterday\u2019s European and US sessions.\n\nOil prices are a touch higher and could take advantage of a weaker dollar, should it fall further ahead of the weekend.\n\nGold continues to flatline as it struggles to break above the 200 and 50-day eMA\u2019s (despite dollar weakness). Our bias is for another dip lower given the series of bearish reversal candles, but we\u2019d likely need to see a resurgence of dollar strength coupled with higher real-yields (TIPS have traded higher for the past 3 days which could indicate the potential for gold weakness over the coming day/s).\n\nAnd we are still waiting for copper to break beneath 4.20 support to signal its next leg lower, yet the series of inside days suggests we may nee to wait a while longer.\n\n\n\n\n\nUp Next (Times in BST)\n\nYou can view all the scheduled events for today using our economic calendar, and keep up to date with the latest market news and analysis here.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to trade with City Index\n\nFollow these easy steps to start trading with City Index today:"}, {"headline": "BUZZ-COMMENT-AUD/USD in a tight spot as negatives pile up", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Nasdaq", "date": "11 hours ago", "image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2021-07-09T015749Z_1_EB1_RTRLXPP_2_LYNXPACKAGER.JPG?1426563161", "author": [], "body": "July 9 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar is on the verge of accelerating its decline as a steadfastly dovish central bank, fears the global economic recovery is losing steam, an unwinding of reflation trades and an extended lockdown in Sydney all take their toll.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia's insistence that interest rates are not likely to rise until 2024 suggests it will lag the U.S. Federal Reserve in tightening monetary policy, which should act as a dead weight on the Aussie .\n\nNascent signs of cooling economic growth in China and the U.S.are also negative for the Aussie.

As for the alignment of the moving averages, well, it\u2019s a bit mixed up; the 20, 50, 100, and 200 do not progress from largest to smallest, or vice versa. The closest is the 20 day average, which is 92.3 pips away. Trend traders will want to observe that the strongest trend appears on the 30 day horizon; over that time period, price has been moving down. Also of note is that on a 90 day basis price appears to be forming a base \u2014 which could the stage for it being a support/resistance level going forward.

Commodity currencies are the worst performing, Focus will now turn to developments in US stocks and yields, on whether they could \u201cbend up \u201d before closing.\n\nTechnically, we\u2019d believe that the key level to watch is 34k handle in DOW, which is slightly below 55 day EMA and medium term trend line support. Sustained break there would at least bring deeper fall back towards 33271.93 support. That might trigger even strong rally in Yen and Franc. However, defending 34k could, at least, help Yen crosses stabilize from the current level.\n\nIn Europe, at the time of writing, FTSE is down -1.93%. DAX is down -2.01%. CAC is down -2.29%.

Being symmetric meaning \u201cnegative and positive deviations of inflation from the target are equally undesirable\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhen the economy is operating close to the lower bound on nominal interest rates, it requires especially forceful or persistent monetary policy action to avoid negative deviations from the inflation target becoming entrenched,\u201d ECB said. \u201cThis may also imply a transitory period in which inflation is moderately above target.\u201d\n\nAlso, HICP will remain the appropriate price measures, while the Governing Council recommends inclusion of owner-occupied housing over time.\n\nPresident Christine Lagarde said, \u201cThe new strategy is a strong foundation that will guide us in the conduct of monetary policy in the years to come.\u201d\n\nRBA Lowe wants to see results, not forecast, for rate hikes\n\nIn a speech, RBA Governor Philip Lowe said, it is \u201cnot enough\u201d for inflation to be \u201cforecast\u201d in the rate of 2-3% target for the central bank to lift interest rates. He emphasized, \u201cWe want to see results before we change interest rates\u201d. Also, \u201cthe bond purchases will end prior to any increase in the cash rate\u201d.\n\nHe added that for inflation be sustainably in target rate, it\u2019s like that \u201cwage growth will need to exceed 3 per cent\u201d. It will take \u201cuntil 2024\u201d for inflation to be sustainably within the target range.\n\nLowe also emphasized that \u201cthe condition for an increase in the cash rate depends upon the data, not the date; it is based on inflation outcomes, not the calendar.\u201d Also, the tapering to AUD 4B purchase in bonds a week \u201cdoes not represent a withdrawal of support\u201d.\n\nA look at falling AUD/JPY and GBP/CHF as risk aversion intensifies\n\nRisk aversion comes back again today, as led by the -807pts, or -2.89%, free fall in Hong Kong HSI. In the currency markets, Yen and Swiss Franc are currently the strongest ones.\n\nAUD/JPY breaks through 82.11 support to as low as 81.50 so far, resuming whole decline from 85.78. Rejection by 55 day EMA is a clear sign of near term bearishness. Such decline is seen as correcting the rise from 73.12 for the moment. Hence, we\u2019d look for strong support from 38.2% retracement of 73.12 to 85.78 at 80.94 to contain downside and bring rebound. However, sustained break of 80.94 will argue that it\u2019s indeed correcting whole up trend from 59.85 and target 73.12/78.44 support zone.\n\nGBP/CHF\u2019s sharp fall today now argues that consolidation from 1.2579 might have completed with three waves up to 1.2853. Immediate focus is now on 1.2579/2610 support zone. Decisive break there will confirm this bearish case and target 100% projection of 1.3070 to 1.2579 from 1.2853 at 1.2362. At this point, we\u2019d expect strong support around 1.2259 resistance turned support to contain downside and bring rebound.\n\nUSD/CHF Mid-Day Outlook\n\nDaily Pivots: (S1) 0.9231; (P) 0.9249; (R1) 0.9276; More\u2026.\n\nUSD/CHF falls sharply today but stays above 0.9141 support. Intraday bias remains neutral at this point first. On the downside, firm break of 0.9141 will argue that whole rebound from 0.8925 has completed. Intraday bias will be turned to the downside for 55 day EMA (now at 0.9115). Sustained break there will pave the way back to retest 0.8925 low. On the upside, though, break of 0.9273 will resume the rally to 0.9471 key resistance instead.\n\nIn the bigger picture, medium term outlook is currently neutral with focus on 0.9471 resistance. Sustained break there will indicate completion of whole decline from 1.0342 (2016 high). Medium term outlook will be turned bullish for a test on 1.0342 high. But, rejection by 0.9471 again will revive bearishness for another fall through 0.8756 low.\n\nEconomic Indicators Update"}, {"headline": "AUD/USD, NZD/USD, AUD/JPY Forecast", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Investing.com", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/redesign/images/seo/investingcom_analysis_og.jpg", "author": [], "body": "we wrote: holding below 7510/30 keeps the medium term outlook negative and eventually we should retest last week\u2019s low at 7445\u2026\n\nWe topped at resistance at 7510/30 perfectly as expected to fall another 75 pips.\n\nsell signal was triggered on Monday.

Hence, we\u2019d look for strong support from 38.2% retracement of 73.12 to 85.78 at 80.94 to contain downside and bring rebound. However, sustained break of 80.94 will argue that it\u2019s indeed correcting whole up trend from 59.85 and target 73.12/78.44 support zone.\n\nGBP/CHF\u2019s sharp fall today now argues that consolidation from 1.2579 might have completed with three waves up to 1.2853. Immediate focus is now on 1.2579/2610 support zone. Decisive break there will confirm this bearish case and target 100% projection of 1.3070 to 1.2579 from 1.2853 at 1.2362. At this point, we\u2019d expect strong support around 1.2259 resistance turned support to contain downside and bring rebound."}, {"headline": "Australia stocks higher at close of trade; S&P/ASX 200 up 0.20% By Investing.com", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Up News Info -", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXNPEE7J009_L.jpg", "author": [], "body": "\n\n\u00a9 Reuters.

But Asian markets are walking another path, as led by the free fall in Hong Kong stocks. Yen surges broadly on risk aversion, followed by Swiss Franc. Commodity currencies are generally pressured, with Aussie weighed down by dovish RBA comments too. Euro, Sterling and Dollar are mixed for the moment, awaiting ECB minutes for more guidance.\n\nTechnically, USD/JPY\u2019s break of 110.41 support suggest rejection by 111.71 key medium term resistance. It\u2019s also a very early sign of larger bearish reversal. Immediate focus will be on 130.02 support in EUR/JPY to double confirm near term bearishness in Yen crosses. Similarly, AUD/JPY is now eyeing 82.11 support and break will resume the whole fall from 85.78.\n\nIn Asia, Nikkei closed down -0.68%. Hong Kong HSI is down -2.40%. China Shanghai SSE is down -0.78%. Singapore Strait Times is down -0.55%. Japan 10-year JGB yield is down-0.0060 at 0.031. Overnight, DOW rose 0.30%. S&P 500 rose 0.34%> NASDAQ rose 0.01%. 10-year yield dropped to as low as 1.296, before closing down -0.049 at 1.321.\n\nS&P 500 hit new records, shrugs off FOMC minutes\n\nUS stocks regained bullishness overnight, with S&P 500 and NASDAQ closing at new record highs. FOMC minutes noted that tapering of asset purchases would happen \u201csomewhat earlier\u201d than expected, after seeing more data over the \u201ccoming months\u201d. Meanwhile, rate hike could also come \u201csomewhat earlier\u201d than expected. The overall messages were largely consistent with the prior statement and projections.\n\nSuggested readings on FOMC minutes:\n\nS&P 500 rose 0.34% or 14.59 pts to close at 4358.13. The current medium term up trend is still on track to 100% projection of 2191.86 to 3588.11 from 3233.94 at 4625.94. In any case, near term outlook will stays bullish as long as 4257.16 support holds, in case of retreat.\n\nHong Kong stocks in free fall on fear of more regulatory crackdown\n\nWhile US stocks were strong, Asian markets are trading notably lower today, as led by the free fall in Hong Kong. Selloff in Chinese tech stocks intensified after the Chinese government announced a step up in oversight on Chinese stocks listing in the US. The announcement came just after the surprised crackdown on ride-hailing giant Didi, days after it\u2019s mega IPO last week.\n\nAt the time of writing, HSI is down -2.5%. Considering the downside momentum, the break of 38.2.% retracement of 21139.26 to 31183.35 at 27346.50 is starting to make outlook bearish. Focus is now on 26782.61 resistance turned support. Sustained break there will suggest that whole rise from 21139.26 has completed at 31183.35 in a corrective three-wave structure. That would at least open up a bearish case for 61.8% retracement at 24976.10 and below.\n\nRBA Lowe wants to see results, not forecast, for rate hikes\n\nIn a speech, RBA Governor Philip Lowe said, it is \u201cnot enough\u201d for inflation to be \u201cforecast\u201d in the rate of 2-3% target for the central bank to lift interest rates. He emphasized, \u201cWe want to see results before we change interest rates\u201d. Also, \u201cthe bond purchases will end prior to any increase in the cash rate\u201d.\n\nHe added that for inflation be sustainably in target rate, it\u2019s like that \u201cwage growth will need to exceed 3 per cent\u201d. It will take \u201cuntil 2024\u201d for inflation to be sustainably within the target range.\n\nLowe also emphasized that \u201cthe condition for an increase in the cash rate depends upon the data, not the date; it is based on inflation outcomes, not the calendar.\u201d Also, the tapering to AUD 4B purchase in bonds a week \u201cdoes not represent a withdrawal of support\u201d.\n\nOn the data front\n\nJapan bank lending rose 1.4% yoy in June, below expectation of 3.0% yoy. Eco Watcher sentiment rose to 47.6 in June, up form 38.1, above expectation of 41.9. Current account surplus widened to JPY 1.87T in May, above expectation of JPY 1.59T.\n\nUK RICS house price balance rose to 83 in June, above expectation of 78. Swiss unemployment rate rose to 3.1% in June, up from 3.0%, above expectation of 3.0%. Germany trade surplus narrowed to EUR 12.6B in May, below expectation of EUR 15.8B.\n\nUSD/JPY Daily Outlook\n\nDaily Pivots: (S1) 110.41; (P) 110.61; (R1) 110.83; More\u2026\n\nUSD/JPY\u2019s break of 110.41 support argues that rise from 107.47 has completed at 111.65, after rejection by 111.71 key resistance. Intraday bias is turned back to the downside for 55 day EMA (now at 109.79) first. Sustained break there will suggest that it\u2019s at least correcting the whole rise from 102.58, and targets 38.2% retracement of 102.58 to 111.65 at 108.18. For now, risk will be mildly on the downside as long as 111.65 resistance holds, in case of recovery.\n\nIn the bigger picture, medium term outlook is staying neutral with 111.71 resistance intact. Though, as notable support was seen from 55 day EMA, rise from 102.58 is mildly in favor to extend higher. Decisive break of 111.71/112.22 resistance will suggest long term bullish reversal. Rise from 101.18 could then target 118.65 resistance (Dec 2016) and above. However, sustained break of 55 day EMA would revive some medium term bearishness, and open up deep fall back towards 102.58 support.\n\nEconomic Indicators Update"}]}, {"id": "AUD/NZD", "price_data":

as UK GDP disappoints", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "FXStreet", "date": "1 hour ago", "image":

British pound was little changed on Friday after the relatively disappointing economic data from the UK. According to the Office of National Statistics (ONS), the economy expanded by 0.8% in May, lower than the previous expansion of 2.0%. This decline is a sign that the economic growth started to weaken even as the economy continued to reopen. Further data showed that the UK industrial production rose by 0.8% while the manufacturing production fell by 0.1%. The two were below the median estimate of 1.5% and 1.0%, respectively. Additionally, the UK construction output declined by 0.8% after falling by 0.7% in the previous month.\n\nGlobal stocks rebounded after falling sharply on Thursday. In the United States, Dow Jones and S&P 500 futures rose by 155 and 12 points respectively. In Europe, major indices like the DAX, FTSE 100, and CAC 40 rose by more than 0.50%. The rebound coincided with the rally of global bond yields. The US, German, and UK 10-year bond yields all rose by more than 4%. This price action in stocks is probably a relief rally after indices declined by more than 1% on Thursday. Still, investors are afraid of slow recovery after PMI data published this week showed that some sectors were started to slow down. Also, there are concerns about the spreading Delta variant of coronavirus.\n\nThe Australian dollar rose today after the relatively mixed economic data from China. Numbers published earlier today showed that the country\u2019s consumer and producer price index declined in June. The CPI declined to -0.4% while the PPI declined from 9.0% to 8.8%. Additional data showed that the country\u2019s outstanding loan growth increased from 12.2% in May to 12.3% in June. Social financing in the country more than doubled. Economic data from China is important for Australia because of the close relationship between the two countries. China buys most of Australia\u2019s goods and services.\n\nAUD/NZD\n\nThe AUDNZD price rose to a high of 1.0710 after the latest mixed data from China. The pair moved above the upper side of the descending channel shown in yellow. It is also at the upper side of the Bollinger Bands and along the 50% Fibonacci retracement level. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has also risen from the oversold level of 30 to 55. Still, the pair will likely resume the downward trend as bears target the lower side of the channel at 1.0658.\n\nEUR/USD\n\nThe EURUSD pair rose to a high of 1.1856, which was along the upper side of the descending yellow channel. The pair is also at the same level as the 25-day moving average while the DeMarker and MACD indicators have kept rising. It is also slightly above the dots of the Parabolic SAR indicator. Therefore, like the AUD/NZD, the pair will likely resume the downward trend as bears target the lower side of the channel.\n\nUS 30\n\nThe Dow Jones futures rose to a high of $34,560 as investors rushed to buy the dips. On the four-hour chart, the index is at the same level as the 25-day and 50-day moving averages while the signal and histogram of the MACD is below the neutral line. The bullish trend will likely continue during the American session although a pullback can\u2019t be ruled out."}, {"headline": "Easy Crypto Review 2021: Is Easy Crypto NZ legit?", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "CryptoNewsZ", "date": "2 hours ago", "image": "https://www.cryptonewsz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Easy-Crypto-Review.png", "author": ["David Cox"], "body": "With a growing demand for digital currency exchanges, buying Ethereum or Bitcoin can be quite a challenging task for beginners who are new to the crypto world. There are many cryptocurrency exchanges in the world that allow fiat and cryptocurrency transfers, but they usually do not offer impressive and advanced features. Easy Crypto is one of the best cryptocurrency exchanges in New Zealand, which enables traders to buy and sell digital coins securely and instantly. It is extending its support to the expansion of the digital currency market not only in New Zealand, but also to other countries including South Africa and Australia. In this Easy Crypto review, we will discuss the features, trading fees, security features, and the ease-of-use of the Easy Crypto platform.\n\nWhat Is Easy Crypto?

It is a regulated exchange, providing a wide range of deposit methods to purchase over 44 cryptocurrencies using AUD, NZD, and ZAR fiat currencies.

They designed the platform to enable users to experience smooth and secure cryptocurrency trading. The Easy Crypto team focused on creating the world\u2019s simplest digital currency exchange and they have successfully expanded their services to different countries, including Australian and South African crypto markets.\n\n\n\nIs Easy Crypto Regulated?\n\nEasy Crypto is a regulated and licensed reporting exchange under the AUSTRAC (Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre) that enforces financial laws and minimizes the risk of criminals and fraudsters who use cryptocurrency platforms for cyber crimes, terrorism financing, and money laundering.\n\nAccording to the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter\u2014Terrorism Financing Act (2006), every regulated trading platform including Easy Crypto, is required to gather information about their customers\u2019 identities, monitor their financial activities, and finally report to the AUSTRAC if transactions seem to be suspicious, or includes hefty amounts over $10,000.\n\n\n\nIs Easy Crypto NZ Safe?\n\nEasy Crypto appears to be one of the safest platforms in Australia that allows users to buy cryptocurrency smoothly and securely. The cryptocurrency exchange has incorporated many precautionary measures to ensure security and safety to their users\u2019 funds:\u2013\n\nVerification Process\n\nThe verification process follows the KYC process per regulation for fiat currency deposits and withdrawals.\n\nRegulation\n\nThe platform is registered under AUSTRAC and fulfils the KYC and AML requirements.\n\nHardware Wallet\n\nBeing a hardware wallet, users can deposit digital currency directly to the cold storage wallets linked to the customer\u2019s bank account.

For the week so far, the index is down 3.2%, the biggest decline since early February.\n\nJapan's Nikkei .N225 slid 2%. Chinese shares were weaker too with the blue-chip CSI300 index .CSI300 off 1.2%.\n\nAustralian shares .AXJO dropped 1.6%, with stay-at-home orders in Sydney, the country's most populous city, tightened further to stop the spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus.\n\nAnalysts said an accumulation of events have triggered a turn in sentiment rather than a single catalyst.\n\nFears central banks will choke economic recovery by tightening policy in their efforts to rein in inflation, a rapidly spreading Delta variant of the coronavirus around the world and still low rates of vaccination have darkened the outlook.\n\nAlso raising concerns for investors were political tensions in the Middle East, Russia and China while Beijing's crackdown on foreign-listed Chinese firms took its toll too.\n\nAs a result, markets are now starting to question one of this year's most successful trades, the so called reflation narrative -- bets that assets that benefit from a strengthening economy and higher inflation will outperform steadier, safer ones.\n\nOvernight, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes US10YT=RR was down 2.8 basis points to 1.293%. It fell as low as 1.25% earlier in the day. The 30-year Treasury bond US30YT=RR slipped 1.9 basis points to 1.925%.\n\nIn equities, the Dow .DJI fell 0.7%, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 0.86% and the technology-focused Nasdaq .IXIC dropped 0.7%.\n\n\"The rate move is a reflection of less accommodative Fed signals & some fading of reflation optimism with an uptick in COVID delta concerns,\" analysts at Bank of America Securities wrote in a note.\n\n\"We believe these factors may continue to pressure rates lower until the market stabilizes and finds a catalyst for rates to re-price back to levels consistent with fundamentals.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a reading on Thursday on the number of Americans filing new unemployment claims added to views that the job market recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be choppy.\n\nIn currencies, the risk sensitive Australian and New Zealand dollars were under pressure, down 0.3% each. AUD=, NZD=\n\nThe safe haven yen JPY= hovered near a one-month high at 109.81 per dollar. The euro EUR= dipped to $1.1836.\n\nThat left the dollar index .DXY, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, slightly firmer at 92.423.\n\nGold XAU=, another safe haven asset, was on track for its best weekly performance since end-May. It was last up 0.1% at $1,804.84 an ounce.\n\nOil prices were weaker in early Asian trades after hefty overnight gains. Brent crude LCOc1 was slipped 19 cents to $73.94 a barrel.

AUD/USD fell from 0.7460 to 0.7418, representing its lowest level since December 2020. It was a similar story for the NZD, which fell from 0.6985 throughout trade to around 0.6935. With the NZD having a worse session than the AUD, the AUD/NZD cross rate rose from Wednesday\u2019s one-month lows to once again trade above 1.0700.\n\nThe risk off move overnight has been attributed to investor caution on the back of a possible slowdown in economic growth and the rising spread of the new delta variant. With Japan announcing a state of emergency and infection rates increasing in countries with high vaccination rates, the outlook for a global reopening is dimming.\n\nLooking forward to the session ahead, the RBNZ are set to announce bond buying plans for the next week at 12pm.

The numbers are enough to overwhelm people and many altogether back out, rather than going through the options to find one that can work for them. Of course, it is not humanly possible to go through each and every option. Not only will this take years, but new options are also being added regularly, so you will never be done. This is the whole point of this FinuTrade review, as it will shed some light on exactly why you should consider this broker. Is it necessary?\n\nYes, it certainly is, or as mentioned above, you will never be done researching and will not be able to trade in the financial markets. Is that what you want? Don\u2019t you want to take advantage of the countless profitable opportunities these markets have to offer? Don\u2019t you want to earn the same fortunes as others have done? Indeed, you do and if you have looked into the process, then you are aware that a broker is essential for you to be able to do so. But, this doesn\u2019t mean just any broker; you need a reliable and professional one that knows what it is doing.\n\nThe problem is that if you have kept up with the markets, then you also understand that there have been some fraudulent and scam platforms that have exploited people. Even if they are not outright scams, there are shady and unregulated brokers that do exist and they cannot be trusted to deliver what they have promised. You could opt for a random platform in order to save time, but there is a good chance that you will find them lacking in one way or another. After all, it is easy for anyone to set up a website on the internet these days and make tall claims, but living up to them is a different ballgame altogether.\n\nUnless you are willing to risk your money and your information, you should always do your homework to know what you are getting into. At the outset, this will require time and effort, but in the long run, you can save yourself from a great deal of hassle and loss. Rather than jumping from platform to platform in search for the right one, it is better to make some effort and choose the right one in the first go. Is FinuTrade that broker? You will only find the answer when you have checked it out thorough and that\u2019s what this review is for.

Security Policy KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) Parent Company FinuTrade Holdings Ltd.\n\nIntroduction to FinuTrade\n\nBased in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, FinuTrade Holdings Ltd. established the FinuTrade platform to help people in tapping into the potential of the financial markets in 2018. It is a relatively new broker in the market, considering that some of them have been operating for decades. Despite this disadvantage, they have managed to develop a strong reputation as their trading volume is in excess of $182 million and have executed more than 69,000 orders. They cater to both retail and institutional traders and provide them a solid trading environment for achieving their goals.\n\nBut, you will probably find many other brokers making the same claims, so you have to understand why FinuTrade should be considered. Some of the reasons for doing so are highlighted below:\n\nReason 1: The Excellent Security\n\nThere is no denying that the internet has transformed our lives and has delivered huge advantages, but if there is one thing you need to remember is that it also has its risks. There are cybercriminals who are looking for just about any opportunity to exploit people and trading online means that you could be exposed to them. They could steal your private and confidential information that you share with a broker, or steal the money you deposit for trading. This is a significant risk that you have to take, due to which you want to minimize it as much as possible.\n\nOf course, the broker also plays an important role in this process, as they have to provide you a strong security infrastructure. It is their network that will be compromised by hackers and other cybercriminals, so they have to protect your information and money. But, not all companies take this task seriously and you can find countless incidents where people had to suffer because their chosen broker didn\u2019t provide adequate security. This is one avenue where FinuTrade has done an outstanding job because they have taken steps to not just ensure the safety of your funds, but your information as well.\n\nThey choose to deposit your funds in segregated accounts, which means that company funds are kept separate from client deposits. This ensures that your money is only used for trading and not for any of the company\u2019s own obligations. In addition, the deposits are kept with the leading financial institutions, so there is a minimal risk of theft. Moreover, if FinuTrade were to file for bankruptcy, your money would be returned to you. As far as your information is concerned, strong SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption has been used to protect all sensitive data accumulated throughout the trading process.\n\nAlong with these measures, you will also come to know that FinuTrade is compliant with the AML (Anti-Money Laundering) and KYC (Know-Your-Customer) security policies. These are internationally recognized and require traders to submit documents for proof of identity and address. The former can be provided via a national ID card, international passport, or driver\u2019s license. The latter requires any utility bill showing your name and address, whether water, electricity or gas, or a bank statement. These documents have to be submitted and verified for you to be able to make transactions via your account.\n\nReason 2: Variety of Instruments\n\nWhile there is no doubt that security is of the utmost importance, you cannot solely make your choice of a broker on that fact alone. There are a number of other aspects that also play a vital role in your choice and should be taken into account in order to ensure that you are not making a mistake. The instruments that you can trade through their platform is one such factor because it can have a big impact on how much profits you end up making at the end of the day. The financial markets are filled to the brim with trading instruments, but the fact is that not all instruments are created equal.\n\nSome are more volatile than others, which means their profitability will also vary. Similarly, the number of instruments available is also worth checking because limited options often lead to higher risks. You want to diversify your investment, as it is regarded as the best way to mitigate the risks associated with trading. But, this can only happen if there are enough options provided to you. No matter which way you look at it, you will learn that FinuTrade offers you all you need. They give their clients access to some of the top financial markets globally and have more than 200 instruments listed.\n\nWith such variety available, it is quite easy for traders to find the instrument that\u2019s in accordance with their risk tolerance and diversify their portfolio. Check out some of the options available:\n\nStock: Of course, the most renowned financial market in the world is none other than the stock market where you have the chance to trade stocks of some of the world\u2019s biggest companies. These include prominent names like Amazon, Boeing, Alibaba, JPMorgan, Tesla and Apple.\n\nForex: Who hasn\u2019t heard of the foreign currency market? There are thousands of currency pairs that can be traded here and FinuTrade has added some of the most profitable ones, including USD/JPY, EUR/USD, NZD/CAD, AUD/NZD, USD/CHF and GBP/USD.\n\nIndices: This is similar to the stock market and is quite lucrative because you can trade baskets of stocks together. There are a number of indices that you can trade, such as Dow Jones, Nasdaq 100, FTSE 100 and CAC 40, amongst others.\n\nCryptocurrencies: Unless you have been living under a rock, you have certainly heard of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is not the only one that exists and FinuTrade has added some of the other popular ones like Litecoin, Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash to help you enjoy returns from this market.\n\nCommodities: For traders who have a low risk tolerance and prefer stable returns, commodities are one of the best options and there are lots of commodities that you can explore. These include hard commodities that refer to precious metals like gold, silver, copper and platinum. You can find soft ones that refer to agricultural products like coffee, corn, sugar and rice. Energy commodities like natural gas and crude oil are also available.\n\nReason 3: The Leading Trading Platform\n\nYou have checked security and you have looked at the instruments and found both of these to be extremely impressive. Does this mean you should sign up? Not yet. You still need to look at the most crucial offering of a broker i.e. their trading platform because it is the one feature you will engage with the most. How will you trade the instruments mentioned above? It is through this platform that you access the financial markets and open the trading positions you want, which means its role cannot be understated.\n\nThere are plenty of trading platforms that already exist in the market and some brokers prefer to develop their own as well. You should see what FinuTrade has opted to do before you make your decision. When you do so, you will find that they have opted to add one of the existing solutions in the market, but this doesn\u2019t mean that they have gone for a random option. Instead of doing so, they have chosen to provide their clients with the leading trading platform in the market i.e. the MT4 (MetaTrader4).\n\nIt is a favorite of all professional traders around the globe, but this doesn\u2019t mean that beginners cannot use it. The MT4 is a highly intuitive and user-friendly trading solution that can fulfill the needs of every trader. The best part is that FinuTrade has added the entire suite of platforms, instead of just one option. This means that you can choose to download the MT4 desktop client for your PCs, use the WebTrader, which is accessed through the browser, or you can opt for the mobile trading apps that are available for iOS and Android ecosystem.\n\nThis provides traders with a great deal of flexibility and gives them the opportunity to trade through a platform they are comfortable with. The desktop platform offers a traditional and powerful trading experience, while the WebTrader saves you from downloading and gives easy access. As for the mobile apps, they are excellent for trading on the move. No matter which option you go with, you will be able to benefit from top-notch technology and that\u2019s FinuTrade\u2019s primary goal. This technology delivers superior trade execution and offers one-click trading to its clients.\n\nAll trade results and market movements are shown in real-time, which can enable traders to maximize their profits and minimize their losses. Moreover, every trader that signs up on FinuTrade can also take advantage of the built-in MT4 trading tools, as well as those that have been added by the broker itself. You will be able to enjoy interactive charts and graphs, trading signals and custom indicators, in-depth market analysis, an economic calendar, currency converter, the latest financial news, profit calculator and plenty more. The combination leads to a smooth trading experience for every trader.\n\nReason 4: Brokerage and Investment Accounts\n\nIt is time to look at the account choices that you have been provided, as it is the norm to open an account with the broker before you can start trading. As FinuTrade is offering its services to traders of all skill levels, they have to offer several account options. No two traders have the same capital, trading style and risk appetite and their experience and knowledge can have a big impact on the account they select. It should also be noted that there are two different options for you to explore when you want to open an account here.\n\nYou can open a brokerage account with FinuTrade that you use for your trading journey, or if you don\u2019t want to take the risk and just want to enjoy regular returns, you can simply use the investment accounts that offer a consistent and regular return. There are four choices available for each category and these include:\n\nSilver Brokerage: This account can be opened with a deposit of $250 and is for newcomers and beginners, so they get limited signals and a free consultation with a personal account manager and a market analyst. A 20% welcome bonus is also given.\n\nSilver Investment: Having the same name, this account at FinuTrade needs an investment of $50,000 and gives a return of 1.5% per month. The money has to be deposited for 24 months at least and interest withdrawals can be made once in a calendar year.\n\nGold Brokerage: You can open this account with a minimum deposit of $10,000 and as it is for intermediate traders, full trading signals and five sessions with a market analyst are given. The welcome bonus is now 50% and an executive account manager is also provided.\n\nGold Investment: For this account, traders are required to make a deposit of $100,000 at FinuTrade and their interest rate is increased to 2.5% per month. The amount has to be deposited for at least 12 months and withdrawals can be made every three months.\n\nPlatinum Brokerage: A minimum deposit of $50,000 is needed for this account, which is aimed at advanced traders. Unlimited sessions are provided with a market analyst and 100% bonus is also given.\n\nPlatinum Investment: You now need to invest $250,000 with FinuTrade in this account, but only for 6 months. The interest rate you receive is 3.75% per month and withdrawals can be made on a monthly basis.\n\nDiamond Brokerage: As this account is for professional traders, they have to deposit a minimum of $250,000 and are given a 125% bonus, along with all other features mentioned above.\n\nDiamond Investment: The investment that FinuTrade requires for this account is $1,000,000 and the return and commitment period is the same as the Platinum account.\n\nApart from these options, you will find that there is also the option of opening a demo account on FinuTrade. This is actually a great feature that every trader can use, whether they are beginners or skilled traders. The former can use this account for practicing their trading strategies and getting a feel of the market before they jump in. This shows them what to expect and can help them be better prepared for their trading journey. The latter can use it for checking out the trading conditions they are provided and whether the broker has been transparent and honest with them or not.\n\nReason 5: Top-Notch Customer Guidance and Support\n\nNot everyone who is trading online has a strong financial background and understanding of the market. As these are not prerequisites, a lot of people jump on the bandwagon and prefer to learn as they go. There is no harm in doing so, providing you have access to the right resources and make the effort. You will have the best resources at your disposal at FinuTrade because they have added a range of educational resources for their clients. There are tutorials, videos and e-books that can be insightful and knowledgeable.\n\nNovices and beginners can use these for understanding the market and how it works. There are also webinars and seminars that FinuTrade has added, which can actually be helpful for skilled traders as well. They can polish their skills and eliminate any mistakes they are making. Other than this, the customer support offered by the broker is also worth noting. There could be a ton of questions you may have about their features and services, or you may encounter a technical problem during trading. No matter what the scenario, you could require help.\n\nIf adequate support is not provided, it could certainly be frustrating because you may not be able to make your trades. It can lead to losses because you may not be able to open and close positions. You certainly don\u2019t want that and to ensure it doesn\u2019t happen, a number of support channels are available at FinuTrade that you can use as per your preference. They have a multilingual support staff because they are offering their services to traders all across the globe. They are available 24/5 and are more than ready to assist you in any way possible.\n\nYou can visit the Contact Us page on the FinuTrade website, where you will find the phone number you can use for reaching out to their team, or the email address. They also have the live chat feature available, or you can contact them via social apps/networks. Otherwise, you can simply fill out the online contact form on their website and schedule a callback when it is convenient for you. No matter which option you choose, you will find their support to be top-notch and responsive.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhen you combine all these reasons together, it is easy to see that FinuTrade can be just the trading solution you need in order to explore the potential of the financial markets."}, {"headline": "FxWirePro: AUD/NZD recovery capped at 5-DMA, outlook bearish", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "EconoTimes", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/uploads/20210708ec804306b283ca84e_th_1024x0.png", "author": [], "body": "AUD/NZD chart - Trading View\n\nAUD/NZD was trading 0.14% higher on the day at 1.0672 at around 09:15 GMT.\n\nThe pair has paused downside, but recovery attempts lack traction, upside capped at 5-DMA.\n\nMACD is biased lower and is below the zero mark.

Price appears to be hitting a resistance level at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement from the April to June swing high/low. The recent deflection also marks a contact point at a descending resistance trendline stemming from the multi-year swing high back in February.\n\nMoreover, the confirmation of that descending trendline has completed the formation of a Falling Wedge pattern, which gives a bullish bias to the currency pair. Thus, a break above the resistance trendline may result in a breakout. However, prices may continue to range within the limits of the cone-shaped pattern in the short term.\n\nNZD/CAD 8-Hour Chart\n\nChart created with TradingView\n\nNZD/CHF Technical Forecast\n\nThe New Zealand Dollar has also made progress this month against the Swiss Franc, although not to the degree seen against the Canadian Dollar. Month-to-date, NZD/CHF is up just over 0.10%. The currency pair has traded in a Descending Channel since moving lower from a multi-year swing high made in late February.\n\nThe 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level from the February to June high/low appears to be providing a degree of support. A break lower would see price approach the rising 200-day SMA. Alternatively, the upper limit of the downward channel poses the most immediate resistance level. If price were to break above that level, the 38.2% Fib and the 100-day SMA present technical barriers.\n\nNZD/CHF 8-Hour Chart\n\nChart created with TradingView\n\nAUD/NZD Technical Forecast\n\nThe New Zealand Dollar has strengthened against the Australian Dollar, with AUD/NZD on track to drop for a fourth consecutive week. The currency pair has traded within a Descending Channel since the June swing high. Support and resistance within the downward channel have been seen throughout the Fibonacci levels set from the May to June high/low.\n\nFurthermore, overhead pressure from the descending 26-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA). If price remains on the current downward path, the 78.6% Fib level is the next barrier to clear before moving lower. Beyond that level puts the May swing low in view. MACD is indicating continued pressure to the downside, although the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is rebounding above its oversold level.\n\nAUD/NZD 8-Hour Chart\n\nChart created with TradingView\n\nNew Zealand Dollar TRADING RESOURCES\n\n--- Written by Thomas Westwater, Analyst for DailyFX.com\n\nTo contact Thomas, use the comments section below or @FxWestwater on Twitter"}, {"headline": "AUD/NZD Up 2 Pips in Last Hour, Entered Today Down For the 6th Consecutive Day; in a Downtrend Over Past 14 Days", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "CFDTrading", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://www.cfdtrading.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/cfdtrading-l2.png", "author": [], "body": "Hourly Update\n\n(Last Updated July 8, 2021 1:45 GMT)\n\nCurrently, AUDNZD\u2019s rate is up 2 pips (0.02%) from the hour prior. It\u2019s been a feast for bulls operating on an hourly timeframe, as AUDNZD has now gone up 4 of the past 5 hours. If you\u2019re a trend trader, consider that the strongest clear trend on the hourly chart exists on the 50 hour timeframe. Price action traders may also wish to note that we see a doji candlestick pattern on AUDNZD. Given that we see downtrend on the 20 hourly candle timeframe, and that such candlestick patterns often denote reversals, this may be worth noting. The moving averages on the hourly timeframe suggest a choppiness in price, as the are all in a mixed alignment \u2014 meaning the trend across timeframes is inconsistent, indicating a potential opportunity for rangebound traders.\n\nAUDNZD End of Day Recap\n\nUpdated 00:30 GMT (04:30 EST)\n\nAUDNZD is down 6 pips (0.05%) since the previous day (opening today near 1.06695), marking the 6th consecutive day it has gone down. Relative to other instruments in the Forex asset class, AUDNZD ranked 21st the previous day in terms of percentage price change.

As for the alignment of the moving averages, well, it\u2019s a bit mixed up; the 20, 50, 100, and 200 do not progress from largest to smallest, or vice versa. The closest is the 200 day average, which is 52.8 pips away. Trend traders will want to observe that the strongest trend appears on the 14 day horizon; over that time period, price has been moving down.

The main reason for cutting our forecasts is the stronger USD. In addition, the RBA has been more dovish about monetary policy than we expected,\u201d says Carol Kong, a strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.\n\n\u201cWe expect AUD/GBP to drift lower over the coming quarters,\u201d Kong says.\n\nAbove: Pound-to-Australian Dollar rate shown at weekly intervals alongside AUD/GBP.\n\nAchieve up to 3-5% more currency for your money transfers. Beat your bank's rate by using a specialist FX provider: find out how.\n\nDespite this week\u2019s adaptation, the RBA is still expected to continue buying Australian government bonds under its quantitative easing programme for at least the remainder of 2021, and for longer than other central banks including the Bank of England (BoE) and Federal Reserve (Fed) among others.\n\nThat, along with the RBA\u2019s insistence that it will likely be 2024 or later before the bank lifts its cash rate, is a potential headwind that CBA says will keep the Australian Dollar on its back foot against many other currencies including the Pound.\n\n\u201cThe RBA\u2019s dovish stance, relative to the BoE), is a near-term weight on AUD/GBP. For example, we expect the BoE will end its asset purchase programme in November. At the same time, the UK\u2019s rapid vaccination drive and broad economic re-opening is also a near-term weight,\u201d Kong says. \u201cWe now forecast AUD/GBP to fall to 0.5373 [GBP/AUD: 1.8751} by the end of March-2022.\u201d\n\nThe RBA said this week that it wants to see inflation lifted so that it sits sustainably within the 2%-to-3% target band before raising interest rates, which could take years yet if the bank\u2019s experience of the last decade is anything to go by, a period in which inflation has remained beneath the target.\n\nPersistent below-target inflation already had the RBA cutting interest rates before the pandemic, in the hope of raising economic activity sufficiently to lift price pressures.\n\nAbove: AUD/USD rate shown at weekly intervals alongside AUD/GBP.\n\n\u201cThe RBA does not expect to raise the cash rate until 2024 while the median fed funds rate projections (dot plot) imply 50bps rate hikes by end of 2023,\u201d says Elias Haddad, a CBA colleague of Kong.\n\n\u201cOur central scenario remains that the RBA will commence normalising the cash rate in November 2022. Still, AUD will stay under downside pressure until Australia\u2019s inflation backdrop improves in favour of our RBA cash rate view,\u201d Haddad says.\n\nCBA downgraded its Australian Dollar forecasts following this week\u2019s RBA announcement, citing the recent shift in stance at the Federal Reserve as well as other central banks, and now looks for the Pound-to-Australian Dollar rate to trade around or above 1.85 {AUD/GBP: 0.54} through the rest of 2021.\n\nChanges to GBP/AUD forecasts were limited in comparison to those announced for the main Australian Dollar exchange rate AUD/USD.\n\nAUD/USD is now forecast to fall back from 0.75 on Friday to 0.74 by the end of September and 0.72 by year-end, the latter of which is a large downgrade from an earlier projection of 0.81.\n\nThat implies almost a five percent decline from Friday\u2019s levels before the curtain closes on 2021.\n\nAbove: Commonwealth Bank of Australia forecasts for selected exchange rates."}, {"headline": "AUD/USD trades to session highs as risk sentiment keeps more positive so far today", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Forexlive", "date": "3 hours ago", "image": "https://az705044.vo.msecnd.net/20210709/9-7-2021-5-56-37-pm.png", "author": [], "body": "AUD/USD turns around the earlier drop to climb to 0.7460\n\n\n\n\n\nThe low today hit 0.7411 in Asian trading, which marked the lowest level for the pair since December, but things are quickly changing now in European trading as risk sentiment is also lookin more positive for the time being.\n\n\n\n\n\nEuropean equities are rallying while US futures are holding modest gains now - S&P 500 futures up 0.3% - as we see a calmer tone in the bond market. 10-year Treasury yields are up by 5 bps to 1.34% and that is helping with the risk mood.\n\n\n\n\n\nChina cutting banks' RRR for the first time since April last year also helps with that.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoing back to AUD/USD, the pair is seeing a mild bounce back above the 23.6 retracement level of the recent swing lower this week @ 0.7544.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is some minor resistance closer to 0.7482 next but the big one to watch in the near-term will be the key hourly moving averages @ 0.7492-96 currently.

inside an inverse cup-and-handle pattern earlier this month, a bearish structure that forms during a price wave downward, followed by a stabilizing period. The technical design typically leads the price lower by as much as the size of the previous decline.\n\nBitcoin topped near $65,000 in mid-April before reversing to the downside in later sessions. The cryptocurrency crashed to as low as $28,800 on June 22 after attempting to keep prices above $30,000 repeatedly. It successfully did so but fell short of extending its bullish reversal momentum after facing comparatively higher selling pressure in the $35,000\u2013$36,000 range.\n\nBitcoin cup-and-handle pattern visualized. Source: TradingView, Keith Wareing\n\nThe pattern\u2019s handle part appeared like it is nearing exhaustion, prompting Wareing to say that Bitcoin\u2019s price would fluctuate inside the structure for another three to four weeks. After that, the cryptocurrency would rally lower, insomuch that it could hit $24,000.\n\n\u201cIf the handle breaks down, expect 24k -29k to be the new range. [...] 3-4 more weeks of range-bound imo,\u201d Wareing wrote in an update on Friday.\n\nNegative outlook throughout riskier assets\n\nBearish warnings for Bitcoin picked up momentum in the weeks after global regulators increased their crackdown against the cryptocurrency sector. For example, in China, the central bank effectively banned all forms of crypto-related activities, including mining, one of the few surviving crypto industries following Beijing\u2019s restriction on cryptocurrency trading in 2018.\n\nMeanwhile, Binance, the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency exchange by volume, came under pressure from regulators in the United Kingdom, Thailand, Canada, Japan, and Cayman Islands over its sprawling crypto operations.\n\nThe U.K.\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority banned Binance from regulated financial activities last month. That prompted Barclays, Faster Payments and Santander to block its banking customers from accessing Binance.\n\nBids for BTC/USD also went down alongside traditional markets on rising concerns about the global economy primarily after days of sharp moves in sovereign bonds hinted at slower growth and inflation than previously anticipated.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing an asset allocation change with people selling risky assets across the board and buying into the safer returns of government bonds,\u201d noted Shaniel Ramjee, senior investment manager at Pictet Asset Management, after yields on the 10-year United States Treasury note fell to as low as 1.276% on Thursday for the first time since February 2021.\n\nYields drop when bond prices rise.\n\nBitcoin shows erratic positive correlation with the U.S.10-year Treasury note yields. Source: TradingView\n\nClem Chambers, CEO of financial analysis service ADVFN, suggested that bulls should wait for a crash before dipping their toes in the Bitcoin market again, noting that the next best accumulation opportunities appear when the cryptocurrency dumps to $20,000.\n\nNevertheless, bulls remained hopeful that Bitcoin\u2019s growing recognition in the mainstream space, especially against the persistent fears of higher inflation, would take the cryptocurrency out of its bearish slumber.\n\n\u201cBitcoin has been trapped for most of the last 3 weeks in a long and tight (8%) trading range $32,500-$35,000,\u201d said Ronnie Moas, founder of Standpoint Research.\n\n\u201cI see 20% downside [on] China, GBTC lockup, or some other negative headline [but] 150% upside between now and the year-end on an exchange-traded fund approval, some other positive headline, [and] supply-side shock.\u201d\n\nThe views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

With BTC/USD prices continuing to volatile, many traders are stuck in the battle between bulls and bears, taking profit from short price swings, regardless of which way the price is headed. The absence of notable triumphs on both sides was aided by a relatively quiet news atmosphere. Although BTC crossed the $35,000 threshold at the beginning of the week, it has since registered a low of $32,111. Despite the recent gain, the BTC price remains tilted towards the $30k floor. Meanwhile, at the time of this post, the price of BTC/USD is consolidating above $32,700. JPMorgan analysts suggest that the probable unlocking of shares in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) could cause Bitcoin\u2019s price to plummet even further. The infusion of institutional investors into the GBTC Grayscale trust fund was one of the key drivers driving the rising trend of BTC.\n\n\n\nKey Levels\n\nResistance Levels: $37,500, $35,000, $33,500\n\nSupport Levels: $32,000, $30,000, $28,000\n\nBTC/USD Daily Chart: Ranging\n\nBTC/USD Daily Chart\n\nBTC continues to trade mixed. While there are attempts made over the last couple of days to bounce back, there is a lack of momentum in its price action. However, buyers are keeping alive the chances of seeing one more leg of rising from current levels to test $35,700 and the moving average (MA 50) respectively before a sharp corrective fall begins.\n\n\n\nBut the price will need to breach $33,500 from here to see an up move from here. The bulls are trying to move up but seem to lack strong follow-through buying. The relative strength index (RSI) is showing signs of rising towards its midline 50 upper range. Overall the $30,000 floor will need to be watched closely to decide whether one more leg of rising is still pending or the correction can come in without seeing this up move.\n\nBTC/USD 4-Hour Chart: Ranging\n\nBTC/USD 4-Hour Chart\n\nOn the 4-hour time frame, we can see that the price is moving sideways. However, we can see that the BTC/USD is also trying to break below the $32,000. A consecutive break below $32,000 should target $31,000 and $30,000. If this happens, we might be on the way towards a $28,800 level retest. If the BTC/USD fails to close below $32,000 then, we should see a further range play.\n\n\n\nPrice action is in a steady short-term consolidation. However, the momentum to the downside is starting to slow. Going by the 4 hour RSI, we could expect a possible attempt for a retest of the $35,000 handle. While to the downside, the previously established floor at $30,000 remains within reach. Given the market conditions, it would be a bit too early to call the direction in BTC/USD prices.\n\nNote: Kryptomoney.com is not a financial advisor.

BTC rebounded from $33K on Monday and pushed higher to meet the upper angle of a symmetrical triangle pattern, as seen on the charts below.\n\nUnfortunately, BTC could not break out and quickly rolled over from there into $33,520 support on Tuesday. After another failed retest of the upper angle on Wednesday (at $35K), BTC heavily rejected and broke to the downside.\n\nSince the breakdown of the triangle, it has found support at $32K, which was the lowest price BTC traded at over the past two weeks, and as of now, BTC is mostly consolidating around the $33K mark.\n\nLooking ahead, the first support lies between $32,730 and $32,270. This is followed by $31,600 (double-bottom support), $31,185 (downside 1.618 Fib Extension), $30,600, and $30,000.\n\nOn the other side, the first resistance lies at $33,000. This is followed by $33,520, $34,000 (20-day MA & descending trend-line), $35,000, and $35,900 (50-day MA).\n\nEthereum\n\nEthereum is trading near the same price from a week ago, amid the $2K mark. The coin bounced from the 20-day MA at around $2080 at the start of the week and pushed higher into the $2340 \u2013 2400 resistance zone (MA-50 and 0.236 Fib level), failing to break above it on two occasions \u2013 Sunday and Wednesday.\n\nAfter multiple failed attempts to sustain $2340, ETH rolled over yesterday after hitting the 50-day MA the day before. It then broke a short-term rising wedge and collapsed back into the 20-day MA zone around $2100. As of earlier today, ETH spiked lower to $2035 (Feb-2021 highs) but has bounced back since, attempting to remain above the 20-day MA once again.\n\nLooking ahead, the first major resistance lies at $2200. This is followed by $2340 \u2013 $2400 (bearish .236 Fib & 50-day MA), $2560 (100-day MA), and $2725 (bearish .382 Fib).\n\nOn the other side, the first support lies at $2100 (20-day MA). This is followed by $2000 (200-day MA), $1888 (.886 Fib), and $1710 (mid-March support).\n\nAgainst bitcoin, ETH/BTC has been trading inside a rising wedge since the end of June. The coin bounced from 0.0636 BTC at the start of the week and pushed higher above the 50-day MA at 0.066 BTC to reach as high as 0.0689 BTC.\n\nThere, it found resistance at a short-term bearish .618 Fib Retracement and rolled over yesterday. Finally, it collapsed beneath the 50-day MA, breaking beneath the wedge, and continued into support at 0.0636 BTC today, provided by a .382 Fib and the lower angle of the price channel.\n\nMoving forward, if the sellers break 0.0636 BTC, the first support lies at 0.0619 BTC (MA-20 & .5 Fib). This is followed by 0.061 BTC, 0.06 BTC, and 0.0585 BTC.\n\nOn the other side, the first resistance lies at 0.065 BTC (50-day MA). This is followed by 0.0689 \u2013 0.07 BTC (short-term bearish .618 Fib), and 0.072 BTC (bearish .618 Fib).\n\nRipple\n\nXRP is down a sharp 7% this week as the coin heads into the $0.6 support area. The cryptocurrency has been trading inside a descending price channel since the start of June and has been trading beneath the 20-day MA since the start of July.\n\nXRP/USD made multiple attempts to break above the 20-day MA, along with the channel, but just like the market sentiment \u2013 failed on every attempt. Yesterday XRP broke down into support at $0.6.\n\nLooking ahead, if the bears continue beneath $0.6, the first support lies at $0.556 (2019 highs). This is followed by $0.5, $0.47, $0.4 (lower angle of the price channel), and $0.35 (Feb 2020 highs).\n\nOn the other side, the first resistance lies at around $0.65 (20-day MA & descending channel). Above the channel, resistance lies at $0.7, $0.736 (200-day MA), and $0.8 (50-day MA, 2020 highs).\n\nJust like against USD, XRP/BTC is also trading beneath a descending trendline and the MA-20. The coin attempted to break the 20-day MA earlier this week but failed to overcome the 2000 SAT resistance level.\n\nSince then, XRP has slowly ground lower as it broke beneath July 2020 lows at 1900 SAT (yesterday) to reach 1850 SAT earlier today.\n\nLooking ahead, the first support lies at 1800 SAT. This is followed by 1660 SAT (200-day MA), 1550 SAT (November 2020 lows), and 1365 SAT (.786 Fib).\n\nOn the other side, the first major resistance lies at 1900 SAT (descending trend line 20-day MA & July 2020 low). This is followed by 2000 SAT, 2120 SAT (bearish .236 Fib), and 2250 SAT (50-day MA).\n\nCardano\n\nADA/USD has remained stationary as it trades around $1.3, where it started the week. ADA has been trading inside an ascending triangle pattern and got rejected by the upper angle earlier this week (at around $1.48).\n\nAfter multiple attempts to break the triangle, and following the sentiment, ADA broke down from $1.40, breaking beneath the 20-day MA line, to reach as low as $1.30. Today, the bulls are battling to maintain the triangle pattern at support provided by the lower angle.\n\nMoving forward, the first support lies at $1.30 (lower angle of the triangle). This is followed by $1.25, $1.20, and $1.10 (200-day MA).\n\nOn the other side, the first resistance lies at $1.40. This is followed by the resistance between $1.46 (100-day MA) and $1.48 (50-day MA). Above $1.50, added resistance lies at $1.53 (bearish .382 FIb).\n\nADA is also trading inside an ascending triangle pattern against BTC. The coin tested the upper angle of this triangle at 4200 SAT throughout the week but failed to break above. ADA/BTC was also held back by resistance at the 50-day MA (~4150 SAT).\n\nYesterday, ADA dropped beneath the 50-day MA and continued lower into the 4000 SAT area, where it found support at the lower angle of the triangle.\n\nLooking ahead, if the bears break the triangle and fall beneath 4000 SAT, the first support lies at 3950 SAT (20-day MA). This is followed by 3820 SAT (.382 Fib), 3540 SAT (downside 1.272 Fib Extension), and 3400 SAT (.5 Fib & 100-day MA).\n\nOn the other side, the first resistance lies at 4150 SAT (50-day MA). This is followed by 4200 SAT (triangle\u2019s upper angle), 4400 SAT, and 4570 SAT (1.414 Fib Extension).\n\nSolana\n\nSOL saw a minor 2% price drop this week as it decreased into the 20-day MA zone. Since the end of June, SOL has been trading inside a symmetrical triangle and tested the upper angle at around $36.80 during this week.\n\nUnfortunately, it could not break above and quickly got rejected to hit the 20-day MA today at $32.86.\n\nMoving forward, the first support beneath the 20-day MA lies at $31.22 (.382 Fib & triangle\u2019s lower angle). This is followed by $30, $29.11(.5 Fib), and $27 (.618 Fib).\n\nOn the other side, the first resistance lies at $34.40 (50-day MA). This is followed by $35.50 (100-day MA), the upper angle of the triangle, and $38.10 (weekly high).\n\nSOL/BTC has been trading inside a longer-term symmetrical triangle pattern since the end of May. It started the week by rebounding higher from support at 0.00095 BTC (20-day MA)., then attempted to push higher during the week but could not overcome resistance at the upper angle of the triangle at 0.0011 BTC.\n\nSOL/BTC has since been rejected from there to hit 0.001 BTC earlier today.\n\nLooking ahead, if the bears break 0.001 BTC, the first major support lies at 0.00095 BTC (.5 Fib, 20-day MA, 50-day MA, & lower angle of the triangle). This is followed by 0.0009 BTC, 0.000873 BTC (.618 Fib), and 0.000824 BTC (100-day MA).\n\nOn the other side, the first major resistance lies at 0.0011 BTC (triangle\u2019s upper angle). This is followed by resistance at 0.0012 BTC, 0.00126 BTC, and 0.0013 BTC."}, {"headline": "Bitcoin trader eyes US dollar for BTC price breakout cue, Ethereum clings to $2K", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "Cointelegraph", "date": "4 hours ago", "image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/1200_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS91cGxvYWRzLzIwMjEtMDcvNjg2MDY3NTItNGViMi00MTBiLWI3ODQtNWMzOTlhNzEwMWY4LmpwZw==.jpg", "author": ["William Suberg"], "body": "Bitcoin (BTC) stayed below the $33,000 mark on Friday, with a fresh price dip also putting an end to altcoin strength.\n\nBTC/USD 1-hour candle chart (Bitstamp).

It was the second time in 10 years that Bitcoin\u2019s mining difficulty had fallen by those margins.\n\nBitcoin just ended its 343rd mining epoch.

It may also be due to users positioning themselves to scoop BTC on dips.\n\nBitcoin Price Analysis\n\nThe crypto and Bitcoin market remains wavy.\n\nAfter touching highs of $36k mid this week, BTC/USDT prices contracted to around $32k on July 8 as bears flew back.\n\nOf note, from the daily chart, Bitcoin prices are trending lower inside a descending channel, sharply reversing from the $36k liquidation line.\n\nEven as prices fall, traders are defiant because of several reasons.\n\nThe drawdown of July 8, for instance, is with relatively low trading volumes\u2014contracting from those of late June 2021. At the same time, BTC/USD prices are within bull bars of June 22-29.\n\nIdeally, a close above $36k could see BTC rally to $40k and even $42k in a buy trend continuation pattern.\n\nOn the flip side, if prices continue to bleed and July 9 inches lower, sellers may find unloading opportunities on pullbacks with targets at $30k.\n\nChart Courtesy of Trading View\n\nDisclosure: Opinions Expressed Are Not Investment Advice.

In another, someone tried to pay him for a cup of coffee, confusing him with cafeteria staff.\n\n\"It hurts, in a way, because you get the impression that you don't belong there,\" he reflected.\n\nBrazil's educational inequalities have only grown during the pandemic, as remote classes force students to rely on resources at home, widening a gap between the haves and the have-nots.\n\nFor months, Luther was reading at night by candlelight in Niter\u00f3i, across the bay from campus, where his student residence often lacked power. He charged his phone and laptop at work and used them to study until his street-sweeping shift from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m.\n\n\"For my course, which demands a lot of reading, I need a better computer than the one I got. But some people aren't even given a computer,\" he said, noting the array of challenges for disadvantaged students forced to study from home. \"Not all phones are good enough for working, and not everyone has a phone ... or enough internet data to download their readings.\"\n\nPROTESTING 'GENOCIDE'\n\nRecent events in Rio have underscored even greater challenges Luther faces as a Black man.\n\nIn May, police stormed Jacarezinho, a poor community in northern Rio, in a raid targeting the Red Command drug gang. The hours-long shootout killed 27 men in the neighborhood and one officer, making it one of the deadliest police operations in the city's history and drawing backlash from human rights groups.\n\nLuther, who has two sisters living a few minutes from Jacarezinho, joined a demonstration in Rio the week after the deadly raid, using the official anniversary of abolition in the country to protest police violence against Afro-Brazilians.\n\n\"NO to genocide against Black people,\" read one protestor's sign.\n\nLuther said he lives in constant fear of police violence and makes a point of staying off the streets in certain neighborhoods at night.\n\n\"Even if I were rich or very famous, I would still be living in a Black body in a city, a state, a country where Black people seem expendable,\" he said.\n\nMore than three-quarters of the almost 9,000 people killed by Brazilian police over the last decade were Black men, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nCONNECTING WITH ANCESTRY\n\nDespite threats, Afro-Brazilian culture continues to thrive in Brazil as it has for centuries.\n\nTwice a week, Luther visits a local \"terreiro\" to practice Umbanda, a religion with origins in West African spiritual traditions. Dressed in all-white clothing with beaded necklaces hanging over his chest, Luther participates in dances, songs and rituals with fellow believers.\n\n\"It connects me with my ancestry,\" he said.\n\nPopularized in Rio in the 1930s, Umbanda, like fellow Afro-Brazilian religion Candombl\u00e9, has roots in the transatlantic slave trade, which brought as many as 5 million enslaved people from Africa to Brazil \u2013 10 times the number brought to the United States.\n\nThose who sought to practice their rituals free from the harassment by Europeans would blend their native traditions with elements of Catholicism, creating syncretic religions now practiced by over half a million people in the country.\n\nBrazilian churches often serve as community centers, like the one where Luther took a free college prep course in 2017, setting him on his journey to PUC-Rio.\n\nOnce he gets his degree, Luther says one of his goals is to begin teaching college prep courses in low-income communities, opening the door for the next generation of aspiring students.\n\n\"I want to give back to other young people by allowing them to hope that this is possible,\" he said.\n\n(See related photo essay here)\n\nRio police draws international ire as 25 killed in drug gun battle\n\n(Reporting by Pilar Olivares and Jimin Kang Editing by Brad Haynes and Lisa Shumaker)\n\n((brad.c.haynes@tr.com; +55 11 5644 7725; Reuters Messaging: brad.c.haynes.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net))\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."}, {"headline": "CAD/JPY Bullish Breakout Potential Near Five-Year-Highs: Q3 Top Trading Opportunities", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "DailyFX", "date": "6 days ago", "image": "https://a.c-dn.net/b/2eiI1p/headline_CANADIAN_DOLLAR_2.JPG", "author": ["James Stanley", "Senior Strategist"], "body": "CAD/JPY Talking Points:\n\nThis is part of the DailyFX Q3 Top Trades.\n\nSee the favorite trades from each DailyFX Analyst for the third quarter.

US equities notched fresh all-time-highs and US Dollar bears made their mark in the first two months of the quarter, with a notable pullback showing in June around the FOMC rate decision.\n\nBut, it was at that same rate decision that kickstarted a round of US Dollar strength that FOMC Chair, Jerome Powell, said that market participants should take the dot plot matrix and the Fed\u2019s forecasts with a grain of salt. That\u2019s what helped to really propel stocks, and risk assets, as it became clear once again that the world\u2019s largest national central bank is backstopping markets and apparently happy to continue doing so.\n\nThis does create some interesting dynamics elsewhere, however, such as around the Japanese Yen and the Canadian Dollar.\n\nThe Bank of Canada created some surprise in April when they became one of the first globalized central banks to start talking about post-pandemic policy. This led to a strong run of Canadian Dollar strength that was similarly supported by rising oil prices. The Bank of Japan, however, continues to hold negative rates as they have since 2016. And there appears to be little sign of anything changing on that front, even as a potential shift appears ahead of or around the Federal Reserve.\n\nThis has supported a strong trend in CAD/JPY that\u2019s propelled the pair up to fresh three-year-highs.

This also came along with a test above the psychological 90 level.\n\nThis keeps the door open for bullish breakout potential ahead of the Q3 open, and this can be followed by first looking for a test of the five-year-high plotted at 91.64, after which another interesting spot opens on the chart around 93.25.

US initial jobless claims rose unexpectedly and job opening fell to add further doubt over the economic recovery. Earlier this week the ISM services PMI report also showed that the employment component contracted for the first time this year, falling from 55.3 to 49.3. And the CESI (City Economic Surprise Index) has been falling over the past few weeks which means data is no long surprising to the upside.\n\nAs markets have been getting revved up on the potential for the Fed\u2019s tapering and bond pricing suggests that inflation may indeed be transitory. Yesterday\u2019s employment data appears to be the straw which broke the camels back and saw positions unwound. This is turn can cause a snowball effect as portfolios are readjusted, so volatility on currency markets rose significantly.\n\nGlobal equity markets were all in the red, the Nasdaq banking index fell -1.5% compared with the Nasdaq 100\u2019s -0.6% fall. The S&P 500 was down -0.86% with all 11 sectors closing lower, led by financial and industrial stocks. Futures markets are all pointing lower so we could be in for a rocky ride in today\u2019s session.\n\n\n\n\n\nASX 200 Market Internals:\n\n\n\n\n\nASX 200: 7341.4 (0.20%), 08 July 2021\n\nInformation Technology (1.25%) was the strongest sector and Healthcare (-0.26%) was the weakest\n\n8 out of the 11 sectors closed higher\n\n5 out of the 11 sectors outperformed the index\n\n92 (46.00%) stocks advanced, 94 (47.00%) stocks declined\n\n8 hit a new 52-week high, 0 hit a new 52-week low\n\n72.5% of stocks closed above their 200-day average\n\n61.5% of stocks closed above their 50-day average\n\n48.5% of stocks closed above their 20-day average\n\nOutperformers:\n\n+ 13.7% - Zip Co Ltd (Z1P.AX)\n\n+ 9.47% - Nuix Ltd (NXL.AX)\n\n+ 6.56% - Nearmap Ltd (NEA.AX)\n\nUnderperformers:\n\n-3.87% - Magellan Financial Group Ltd (MFG.AX)\n\n-3.11% - Perseus Mining Ltd (PRU.AX)\n\n-2.77% - Chalice Mining Ltd (CHN.AX)\n\n\n\n\n\nForex: CHF and JPY soar during turbulent trade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSafe haven currencies CHF and JPY were the clear leaders overnight, with some of the currency pairs rising between 2-3 times their usual daily ranges. As is usually the case during times of turbulence, commodity currencies were offloaded to see NZD, AUD and CAD as the weakest currencies.\n\nNZD/CHF fell over -2% during its most bearish (and volatile) session since March 2020 and AUD/CHF fell around -2% to a 6-month low. The Swiss franc was the favoured safe haven as CHF/JPY actually rose 0.3% despite the ye also taking in safety flows.\n\nThe US dollar index (DXY) fell -0.3% to a two-day low after finding resistance at the 92.78/83 gap on the daily chart. We outlined the potential for the dollar to retrace yesterday but the volatility was much higher than anticipated. Perhaps a base can form at trend support projected from the June 1st low, whilst a break beneath it brings 92.00 into focus (near the 200-day eMA).\n\n\n\n\n\nIncidentally, USD/JPY topped at the March 2020 high (or the pandemic high) and bearish momentum has accelerated to see prices invalidate the bullish channel. To provide perspective, USD/JPY retraced -3.15% in the first three weeks of April, so if we are to see a retracement of similar size then price could fall to around 108.11.\n\nUSD/JPY found support at the 50% retracement level, although traders across Asia are yet to react. However, be warned that volatility can cut both ways during times if turbulence. Therefore, there are two basic approaches to consider on USD/JPY. Bears can either seek continuation patterns on intraday timeframes (pennants, triangles, flags etc) and step aside if bullish momentum returns. Or wait to see if a retracement find resistance, perhaps somewhere around the broken trendline or the 110.21 \u2013 110.67 zone.\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn how to trade forex\n\n\n\n\n\nCommodities escape the wrath of volatile trade:\n\nAll things considered, commodity markets got off lightly as the baulk of volatility was seen across equity and FX markets. Gold was effectively flat although printed another bearish pinbar / Doji and closed beneath the 20, 50 and 200-day eMA\u2019s. Copper printed a bearish inside day yet held above its 100-day eMA (we\u2019re looking for a break beneath 4.20 to suggest another dip lower). Platinum saw an intraday break of its retracement line on the daily chart yet closed on it, so not quite the confirmation we were hoping to see to suggest it was ready to roll over once more.\n\nOil prices were higher as crude and gasoline inventories fell more than expected. Brent rose 1.3% and is currently around 0.6% higher in early Asian trade, so this has invalidated our near-term bearish bias.\n\n\n\n\n\nUp Next (Times in AEST)\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can view all the scheduled events for today using our economic calendar, and keep up to date with the latest market news and analysis here.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to trade with City Index\n\nFollow these easy steps to start trading with City Index today:\n\nOpen a City Index account, or log-in if you\u2019re already a customer.

This move is a reversal from the hour prior, which saw price move down. Regarding the trend, note that the strongest trend exists on the 100 hour timeframe. The moving averages on the hourly timeframe suggest a bullishness in price, as the 20, 50, 100 and 200 are all in a bullish alignment \u2014 meaning the shorter durations are above the longer duration averages, implying a sound upward trend.\n\nCHFJPY End of Day Recap\n\nUpdated 00:30 GMT (04:30 EST)\n\nCHFJPY is down 71 pips (0.59%) since the previous day (opening today near 119.586), marking the 2nd day in a row a decline has happened. Relative to other instruments in the Forex asset class, CHFJPY ranked 31st the previous day in terms of percentage price change. Here is a price chart of CHFJPY.\n\nCHFJPY Technical Analysis\n\nNotably, CHFJPY is now close to its 20, 50, 100 and 200 day moving averages, which may act as price barrier for the asset. As for the alignment of the moving averages, well, it\u2019s a bit mixed up; the 20, 50, 100, and 200 do not progress from largest to smallest, or vice versa. The closest is the 100 day average, which is 39.1 pips away. Volatility for CHFJPY has been contracting over the past two weeks relative to volatility over the past month. Whether volatility reverts will be something to watch. The clearest trend exists on the 90 day timeframe, which shows price moving up over that time. It should be noted, though, that a trend in the opposite direction, going down, exists on the 30 day timeframe. Also of note is that on a 14 day basis price appears to be forming a base \u2014 which could the stage for it being a support/resistance level going forward.

But with the labour force rising by just 151,000 and still more than three million below its pre-pandemic peak, we aren\u2019t entirely convinced that this is the start of a much stronger trend,\u201d says Andrew Hunter at independent research and consultancy Capital Economics.\n\n\u201cThe key event next week will be the release of the minutes from the Fed\u2019s June meeting, which are likely to provide more details of discussions about asset purchase tapering,\u201d Hunter adds.\n\nWednesday\u2019s minutes are set to hit the wires hard on the heels of June\u2019s non-farm payrolls report, which showed employment rising by almost 1 million last month and lifted the six-month rolling average of payrolls growth to a robust 481k.\n\nAbove: Pound-to-Dollar rate shown at daily intervals with Fibonacci retracements of Feb-to-June rally indicating support levels, alongside selected moving-averages.\n\nAchieve up to 3-5% more currency for your money transfers.

The calendar is quite light, with the highlight probably being the release of the FOMC minutes on Wednesday evening. Much focus will be given to how the doves and hawks are arguing their cases,\u201d Turner adds.\n\nThe Dollar ended last week on its back foot even after Friday\u2019s payrolls surprise, enabling the Pound-Dollar rate to rise back above a 1.38 handle that had appeared in danger of ceding and potentially indicating the directional bias of the U.S. currency ahead of this Wednesday\u2019s minutes, although it\u2019s the market\u2019s reading of and response to the minutes that will dictate how and where GBP/USD ends the week.\n\nThe risk is that Wednesday\u2019s meeting notes bring attention back to bear on the Fed\u2019s $120 billion per month quantitative easing (QE) programme and questions about what would be the most appropriate time to begin winding it down and the pace at which such an exercise should be carried out; potentially leading to increased bond yields and, or a bid for the Dollar in the latter half of the week.\n\nAbove: Pound-to-Dollar rate shown at daily intervals with Fibonacci retracements of correction from early June highs and key moving-averages indicating possible areas resistance to any recovery.\n\n\u201cThe US fiscal stimulus is by far the largest in G10, helping the US outgrow the rest of the world and likely supporting USD this year and possibly next. The Fed is on track to announce tapering at an upcoming meeting, and we continue to think the September meeting is most likely, with tapering starting at the turn of the year,\u201d says Michalis Rousakis, a strategist at BofA Global Research.\n\n\u201cOur key difference with the consensus is that we expect the USD to rally against currencies of central banks that will not be normalizing policies, including EUR, CHF, JPY and SEK, but not necessarily against the rest. Indeed, this is exactly how G10 FX has performed this year, with CAD, GBP, USD and NOK at the top, JPY, CHF, SEK and EUR at the bottom, and AUD and NZD in the middle,\u201d Rousakis adds.\n\nThe Dollar has been lifted in the last month by a lessening of bearish sentiments toward it which was brought about by evolving expectations for Fed policy, with investors and traders increasingly wagering that the bank could raise its interest rate before the end of next year, before lifting it back to 1% by the end of 2023 even as Chairman Jerome Powell poured cold water over other policymakers\u2019 suggestions that any changes to interest rates are in any way likely within this time period.\n\nAbove: Goldman Sachs graph showing market expectations for changes in major central bank policy rats (BoE in red).\n\n\u201cThere are still a number of open questions around the Fed\u2019s balance sheet, including the taper announcement timeline, the duration of the tapering process, and whether the committee will rule out rate hikes while the balance sheet is still growing,\u201d says Zach Pandl, co-head of global foreign exchange strategy at Goldman Sachs.\n\nProspects for U.S. interest rates have dominated the market conversation even as Chairman Powell and others made clear in June that the Fed\u2019s policy priority is the government bond buying programme and its eventual, gradual winding down, details of which may or may not be revealed by Wednesday\u2019s meeting minutes: To the extent that these do reveal anything about the likely timing of a decision by the Fed to reduce its footprint in the U.S. government bond market they will determine whether the Pound-Dollar rate holds onto or gives up the 1.38 handle ahead of Friday\u2019s GDP report.\n\n\u201cMinutes from the June 15-16 FOMC meeting, released on Wednesday, may help clarify Fed officials\u2019 views on the exit path.

The advance is expected to be limited given the overall lack of yield support with gains concentrated against the Euro, yen and Swiss franc.\n\nThe bank expects relatively narrow ranges will prevail in global exchange rates.\n\nUS Dollar Advance against Low-Yield Currencies\n\nBNP Paribas expects that a stronger global economy will be a key driver of exchange rates over the second half of 2021.\n\nAs far as the dollar is concerned, the bank expects that the Federal Reserve will take a measured step towards policy tightening, especially with strong US demand.\n\n\u201cAs the US recovery proceeds and the Fed gets closer to reducing policy accommodation, we expect US real yields to edge up.\u201d\n\nBNP expects that the increase in yields will provide an element of dollar support, but the absolute level of yields will remain relatively unattractive. In this environment, the dollar gains are likely to be concentrated against currencies where central banks will be even slower to tighten monetary policy.\n\nBNP looks at longer-term trends from economic cycles and notes that the dollar tends to strengthen ahead of Federal Reserve interest rate increases before weakening once rates actually increase.\n\n\u201cUSD gains are likely to be most pronounced versus currencies where the market cannot price a meaningful exit from easy monetary policy, notably the CHF, JPY and EUR.\u201d\n\nThe Euro to Dollar (EUR/USD) exchange rate is forecast to weaken to 1.1400 at the end of 2022.\n\nExport Earnings Boost Commodity Currencies\n\nAs the global economy tends to normalise, BNP expects there will be investor support for currencies where there are strong commodity earnings or interest rates are expected to increase.\n\n\u201cIn contrast, we expect a number of emerging market and G10 currencies with commodity exposure or where central banks are likely to hike in tandem with \u2013 or ahead of \u2013 the Fed to hold up well and even outperform the USD.\u201d\n\nIn this context, it expects that commodity currencies will maintain a firm tone and hold their own against the US currency.\n\nPound Sterling (GBP) Exchange Rates Remain Attractive\n\nBNP remains constructive surrounding the Pound Sterling outlook. The bank expects that there is scope for UK yields to increase further as the Bank of England is likely to be one of the early movers in removing policy accommodation.\n\n\u201cComparing the market pricing for rate hikes across the G10, the Bank of England looks conservatively priced, especially considering its less-restrictive forward guidance.\u201d\n\nUK assets continued to under-perform in the 2016-2020 period as Brexit uncertainty curb investor inflows. According to BNP, there is scope for a further catch-up effect over the next few months.\n\n\u201cWe also maintain our positive view on UK equities, as these have lagged the broader rotation into Value stocks, and this could benefit the GBP.\u201d\n\nThe Euro to Pound (EUR/GBP) exchange rate is forecast to weaken to 0.83 at the end of 2022.\n\nAbove: Table of currency forecasts from BNP Paribas covering period 2021-2022."}]}]
