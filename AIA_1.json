Avatar", "Posted", "July Pm"], "body": "CeFi now offers highly competitive rates for cryptocurrency and fiat - how can you take advantage?\n\nEarning interest on assets you already own is perhaps the easiest way to grow your portfolio.\n\nThe risk is considerably lower than trading, and doesn't require fresh capital. Plus it puts lazy money to work.\n\nBut where is the best place to earn interest for cryptocurrency users?\n\nMost people think of DeFi as the only way of earning interest (ie, yield) on crypto assets. But there's a much easier and lower-risk alternative for earning interest: Centralized Finance (CeFi).\n\nBest of all? The rates can be just as good, if not better.\n\nCeFi vs DeFi lending rates\n\nTake a look at this table from DeFi Rate which tracks lending rates for leading CeFi platforms.\n\nThen compare that to the rates for three of the biggest DeFi protocols.\n\nThe CeFi lenders (BlockFi, Nexo and Celsius) all currently offer higher rates than their DeFi counterparts (Compound, AAVE and Yearn). They also offer the highest rates for many assets, which we've highlighted in green boxes.\n\nWhy the higher numbers? CeFi lenders use more traditional business models which allow them to offer more stable rates. They lend your funds out to individual borrowers and institutions with fixed repayment rates. That makes for a more predictable rate.\n\nConversely, DeFi protocols mainly use variable rates that are dictated by algorithms, which respond to changes in the market every few minutes.\n\nDeFi protocols also suffer from popularity\n\nWhen a protocol becomes popular, more lenders flock to it in order to earn yield. If the number of borrowers doesn't increase proportionally, then the interest rates for lenders go down.\n\nAs a centralised business, CeFi lenders can avoid this. They can prop up rates by sacrificing their own capital, or cap deposit amounts for individual lenders.\n\nFor instance, Celsius currently guarantees \"6.20% on 1st BTC, 3.51% after\".\n\nSo you don't just get potentially higher rates, but they are more stable, allowing you to forecast your returns and plan accordingly.\n\nCeFi isn't just eating up DeFi. Banks are also in the crosshairs. Just take a look at the rates offered on fiat deposits from Nexo.\n\nA 10% rate absolutely smashes anything conventional banks are offering these days. And unlike DeFi which is restricted to digital assets, CeFi providers accept your old-fashioned dollars, pounds and euros. Celsius is also offering 8.88% on AUD, CAD and HKD stablecoins.\n\nInsurance and risk\n\nAnother upside to using CeFi is insurance.\n\nAs a traditional business, CeFi platforms have more access to insurance options than their DeFi counterparts. Insurance policies vary between providers, ranging from comprehensive to \"nothing to see here\". Here are some example approaches from industry leaders:\n\nNexo: Digital assets are insured through a combination of specialist policies, up to a total of $375 million. Nexo plans to increase this amount to $1 billion by the end of 2021.\n\nDigital assets are insured through a combination of specialist policies, up to a total of $375 million. Nexo plans to increase this amount to $1 billion by the end of 2021. Celsius: Celsius doesn't guarantee insurance itself, but user assets are custodied with FireBlocks and PrimeTrust who have their own insurance policies. Details of those policies haven't been disclosed, however.\n\nBlockFi: BlockFi doesn't publicly disclose any sort of insurance policy.\n\nAnother key benefit of using CeFi is avoiding fees. You only need to transfer your assets once. DeFi protocols can require multiple transactions which can easily eat away at your profits.\n\nSo we've gone through the benefits, but what about the risks?\n\nSmart contract risk: CeFi lenders still utilise smart contracts which makes them vulnerable to many of the same risks as DeFi protocols. Some even use DeFi protocols to generate a portion of returns.\n\nCeFi lenders still utilise smart contracts which makes them vulnerable to many of the same risks as DeFi protocols. Some even use DeFi protocols to generate a portion of returns. Deposit limits: There is typically a deposit limit for high-interest rate products, with the rates decreasing once the limit is crossed.\n\nCentralisation: By using a CeFi platform you are trusting your cryptocurrency with a third party, rather than a smart contract which allows you to retain control over your private keys.\n\nEven with the risks in mind, CeFi offers a seriously attractive alternative to DeFi.\n\nRates are stable and competitive, risk is reduced, and the process is straightforward. There's no need to learn how to use dapps, or chase yield across multiple protocols.\n\nAn increasing number of exchanges such as Binance, Crypto.com and KuCoin now offer lending products, which makes it even easier to keep your finances in one place.\n\nCompare cryptocurrency lenders and start putting your money to work\n\nInterested in cryptocurrency?

With most US investors enjoying 4th of July holiday celebrations price action was muted as liquidity and volume were thin. The AUD bounced between 0.7510 and 0.7540 for much of the day unable to extend upward momentum and recoup losses suffered mid-June. Despite improving risk appetite and elevated commodity prices Investors appear reluctant in extending risk appetite gains. Uncertainty surrounding the Delta variant and global economic recovery have overcome the long run reflation narrative and continue to weigh on the AUD through the near-term. Our attentions today turn to the RBA policy update. Today\u2019s meeting has been billed as a tipping point, wherein policy makers will announce an amendment to the current stance on QE and monetary policy. Market consensus suggest the board will begin tapering bond purchase while maintaining the April 2024 yield curve target. A surprise announcement could spark price action and an interesting market response. A dovish narrative could sink the AUD and see the currency test lows below 0.7450.\n\nKey Movers\n\nFourth of July celebrations meant liquidity across major currencies remained thin through trade on Monday, prompting little price action and narrow ranges. The Euro, GBP, CAD and JPY all tracked sideways reluctant to extend moves outside a 0.2% plus/minus. The Euro did test a break back toward 1.19, touching intraday day highs at 1.1880 after service PMI data surpassed expectations. However, a dip in investor confidence saw the combined unit slip back toward 1.1850 before edging slightly higher into this morning\u2019s open. Our attentions turn now to the US ISM service PMI index. Having touched near record highs in May there is an expectation the index will correct lower in June, however as the US economic recovery gather pace a surprise to the upside is not out of the question. We are keenly attuned to the underlying indicators held within the dataset, particularly input costs. With inflation pressures growing a sustained uptick in through costs driven by supply constraints will likely mean transitory price pressures will remain in play through the near term.\n\nExpected Ranges\n\nAUD/USD: 0.7450 - 0.7630 \u25b2\n\n\n\nAUD/EUR: 0.6290 - 0.6410 \u25b2\n\n\n\nGBP/AUD: 1.8290 - 1.8550 \u25bc\n\n\n\nAUD/NZD: 1.0650 - 1.0770 \u25b2\n\n\n\nAUD/CAD: 0.9230 - 0.9350 \u25b2"}, {"headline": "Euro Shrugs Strong Investor Confidence, Markets in Subdued Holiday Trading", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Action Forex", "date": "21 hours ago", "image": "https://www.actionforex.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/f-eur132.jpg", "author": [], "body": "Overall, the forex markets are relatively mixed today and trading will probably continue to be subdued with US on holiday. Sterling is currently the stronger one, followed by Yen and Aussie. Canadian is the weakest, followed by Kiwi and then Swiss. Eurozone is mixed despite strong investor sentiment data. But all major pairs and crosses are staying inside Friday\u2019s range. Some volatility could finally be seen again, especially in Aussie, with RBA rate decision scheduled in the upcoming Asian session.\n\nTechnically, it looks like AUD/CAD has defended 0.9247 key support again. Further rebound tomorrow, subject to RBA\u2019s decision and statement, could pop the cross back towards 0.9394 resistance. Firm break there will complete a double bottoming pattern (0.9258, 0.9245), and turn near term outlook bullish. We\u2019ll see if that would happen.\n\nIn Europe, at the time of writing, FTSE is up 0.52%. DAX is up 0.05%. CAC is up 0.35%. Germany 10-year yield is up 0.0232 at -0.211.

Japan 10-year JGB yield dropped -0.0104 to 0.036.\n\nEurozone Sentix investor confidence rose to 29.8, but expectations dropped\n\nEurozone Sentix Investor Confidence rose to 29.8 in July, up from 28.1, but missed expectation of 30.2. Nonetheless, it\u2019s still the 5th increase in a row, and highest since February 2018. Current situation index rose from 21.3 to 29.8, 5th increase in a row, and highest since October 2018. Expectations index, however, dropped from 35.3 to 29.8, lowest since December 2020.\n\nSentix said, \u201cthe result is impressive\u201d but, \u201cwe are approaching a certain point of maximum momentum in the short term\u201d as expectations dropped. \u201cFor the economy as a whole, this is not yet a worrying decline. For the equity markets, on the other hand, which are very much focused on investor expectations, this development could contribute to increased market volatility.\u201d\n\nIt added, \u201cin this environment, the ECB remains in focus. So far, there is no sign of a turn away from the expansive monetary policy. However, the inflation barometer, which remains clearly in negative territory at -38.25, underscores the danger of further rising inflation rates in a globally increasingly synchronised, strong economic upswing.\u201d\n\nEurozone PMI composite reached 16-yr high, recovery stepped up a gear, but inflationary pressures ratcheted higher\n\nEurozone PMI Services was finalized at 58.3 in June, up from May\u2019s 55.2. PMI Composite was finalized at 59.5, up from May\u2019s 57.1. That\u2019s also the highest level in 15 years since June 2006. Looking at some member states, Ireland PMI composite dipped to 2 month low at 63.4. Spain hit 256-month high at 62.4. Germany hit 123-month high at 60.1. Italy reached 41-month high at 58.3. France also reached 41-month high at 57.4.\n\nChris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit said: \u201cEurope\u2019s economic recovery stepped up a gear in June, but inflationary pressures have also ratcheted higher\u2026 A wave of optimism that the worst of the pandemic is behind us has meanwhile propelled firms\u2019 expectations of growth to the highest for 21 years, boding well for the upturn to gain further strength in coming months.\n\n\u201cFirms are increasingly struggling to meet surging demand, however, in part due to labour supply shortages, meaning greater pricing power and underscoring how the recent rise in inflationary pressures is by no means confined to the manufacturing sector. Service sector companies are hiking their prices at the steepest pace for over 20 years as costs spike higher, accompanying a similar jump in manufacturing prices to signal a broad-based increase in inflationary pressures.\u201d\n\nUK PMI services finalized at 62.4, composite at 62.2\n\nUK PMI Services was finalized at 62.4 in June, down slightly from May\u2019s 62.9. That\u2019s still the second-highest reading since October 2013. PMI Composite dropped to 62.2, down from 62.9. That\u2019s also the second-highest reading since January 1998.\n\nTim Moore, Economics Director at IHS Markit: \u201cThe service sector recovery remained in full swing during June as looser pandemic restrictions released pent up demand for business and consumer services. Sales growth eased slightly from May\u2019s recent peak, but capacity constraints and staff shortages meant that many service providers struggled to keep up with new orders\u2026\n\n\u201cThe latest survey data highlighted survey-record rates of input cost and prices charged inflation across the service sector, reflecting higher commodity prices, transport shortages and staff wages. Imbalanced supply and demand was the main driver, while the roll-back of pandemic discounting by some service providers amplified the latest round of price hikes.\u201d\n\nBoJ upgraded economic assessment of 2 regions, downgraded 2, kept 5 unchanged\n\nIn the Regional Economic Report, BoJ upgraded economic assessment of 2 regions (Hokuriku and Kinki), downgraded 2 regions (Chugoku and Shikoku), and kept 5 regions unchanged (Hokkaido, Tohoku, Kanto-Koshinetse, Tokaiand Kyshu-Okinawa).\n\nIt added: \u201cwhile they reported that their economy had remained in a severe situation due to the impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) \u2014 with some reporting that it had seen a slowdown in the pace of its pick-up \u2014 many reported that it had picked up as a trend or had started to pick up.\u201d\n\nGovernor Haruhiko Kuroda told branch managers, \u201cJapan\u2019s economy remains in a severe state but is picking up as a trend\u2026 As the pandemic\u2019s impact gradually eases, the economy will recover thanks to increasing external demand, loose monetary policy and the effect of government stimulus measures.\u201d\n\nAustralia retail sales rose 0.4% mom in May, impacted by Victorian lockdown\n\nAustralia retail sales rose 0.4% mom, 7.7% yoy in May. That\u2019s an upward revision to preliminary result of 0.1% mom rise.\n\nBen James, Director of Quarterly Economy Wide Surveys, said: \u201cThe main themes from the Retail Trade Preliminary release remain relevant for the Final release. Retail turnover in May was impacted by the Victorian lockdown from May 28 onwards, as well as those states recovering from restrictions in April.\u201d\n\nAustralia AiG construction dropped to 55.5, facing capacity constraints\n\nAustralia AiG Performance of Construction dropped -2.8 pts to 55.5 in June. Current activity dropped -0.9 to 54.8. Employment dropped -6.1 to 58.3. New orders rose 0.9 to 56.1. Supplier deliveries dropped -8.5 to 50.9. Input prices rose 2.5 to 98.3. Selling prices rose 7.0 to 85.2. Average wages rose 5.4 to 70.4.\n\nAi Group Head of Policy, Peter Burn, said: \u201cAustralia\u2019s construction industry continued its run of strong growth in June but the pace of expansion is slipping as it faces capacity constraints and rising input prices.\u201d\n\nAlso released, building permits dropped -7.1% mom in May, versus expectation of -5.0% mom.\n\nChina Caixin PMI services dropped to 50.3, PMI composite dropped to 50.6\n\nChina Caixin PMI Services dropped to 50.3 in June, down from 55.1, well below expectation of 55.7. There were the softest increase in activity and new work for 14-months. Staff numbers fell as capacity pressured eased. Rates of input cost and output charge inflation slowed notably. PMI Composite dropped to 50.6, down from 53.8, worst in 14-month.\n\nWang Zhe, Senior Economist at Caixin Insight Group said: \u201cOverall, activity in both the manufacturing and services sector continued to expand. However, impacted by the resurgence of the virus in some regions in China, the services sector was weaker than the manufacturing sector, both in terms of market supply and demand or employment.\u201d\n\nEUR/USD Mid-Day Outlook\n\nDaily Pivots: (S1) 1.1823; (P) 1.1849; (R1) 1.1890; More\u2026\n\nOutlook in EUR/USD remains unchanged and intraday bias stays neutral first. Further fall is expected as long as 1.1974 resistance holds. Break of 1.1806 will resume the decline from 1.2265, as the third leg of the consolidation pattern from 1.2348, to 1.1703 support. On the upside, break of 1.1973 resistance will turn bias back to the upside for 1.2265 resistance.\n\nIn the bigger picture, rise from 1.0635 is seen as the third leg of the pattern from 1.0339 (2017 low). Further rally could be seen to cluster resistance at 1.2555 next, (38.2% retracement of 1.6039 to 1.0339 at 1.2516). This will remain the favored case as long as 1.1602 support holds. Reaction from 1.2555 should reveal underlying long term momentum in the pair. However sustained break of 1.1602 will argue that the rise from 1.0635 is over, and turn medium term outlook bearish again.\n\nEconomic Indicators Update"}, {"headline": "AUD/CAD May Be a Catch-Up Trade in Q3: Q3 Top Trading Opportunities", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "", "date": "23 hours ago", "image": "https://forextv.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/favicon.ico", "author": ["Cad Editor"], "body": "Coming in to Q2 my trade of short AUD/CAD had been predicated on US exceptionalism and the growing divergence between the BoC and RBA.

Unemployment rose to 5.9% from 5.8% but markets were seemingly happy to look beyond that as a blip.\n\nUS equities went into overdrive mode with the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 accelerating higher at their record high. After seven consecutive days of gains it is now the best run for the S&P 500 since 1997.\n\nThe ASX 200 is trading in a potential triangle formation on the daily chart. We said the same thing last week, only for price action to evolve, invalidate the pattern and begin forming a new one. Something that should be factored in here is the time of year, so this may well just be a seasonal thing as opposed to a build-up to a convincing break. The fact we have a bullish and bearish pinbar on consecutive days last week underscores its lack of direction, so perhaps trading intraday ranges may be the best play until we see a convincing breakout, one way or another.\n\n\n\n\n\nASX 200 Market Internals:\n\n\n\n\n\nASX 200: 7308.6 (0.59%), 02 July 2021\n\nConsumer Discretionary (1.3%) was the strongest sector and Information Technology (-0.11%) was the weakest\n\n9 out of the 11 sectors closed higher\n\n3 out of the 11 sectors outperformed the index\n\n128 (64.00%) stocks advanced, 61 (30.50%) stocks declined\n\n72.5% of stocks closed above their 200-day average\n\n66% of stocks closed above their 50-day average\n\n52.5% of stocks closed above their 20-day average\n\nOutperformers:\n\n+ 20.3% - IDP Education Ltd (IEL.AX)\n\n+ 5.16% - A2 Milk Company Ltd (A2M.AX)\n\n+ 5.00% - Nickel Mines Ltd (NIC.AX)\n\nUnderperformers:\n\n-5.28% - IPH Ltd (IPH.AX)\n\n-4.37% - Megaport Ltd (MP1.AX)\n\n-2.99% - Netwealth Group Ltd (NWL.AX)\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the Weekly COT Report (Commitment of Traders)\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Tuesday 29th July 2021:\n\nNet-short exposure to the US dollar was reduced by -6.6 billion dollars accord to calculations from IMM, meaning 11.1 billion of short exposure has been reduced over the past two weeks.\n\nTraders are their most bearish on Japanese yen futures since May 2019, with net-short exposure being increased by 16k contracts. Gross shorts were increased by 9.3k contracts and gross shorts reduced by 6.7k contracts.\n\nElsewhere, weekly volume changes were quite across FX majors.\n\nTraders were bearish on AUD futures for a sixth consecutive week.\n\nGold futures traders had their lowest net-long exposure in two years.\n\nCopper saw its first increase in net-long exposure in 8-weeks. Whilst by a relatively small amount, its 1-year Z-score is at -2.1 standard deviations, so perhaps there is a case to build for a trough to form on copper prices.\n\nPlatinum also saw a slight increase in net-long exposure, although 25k short contracts were cut \u2013 its largest weekly decline since November 2019.\n\nLong/short positioning (75% and above):\n\nCAD futures: 75.2%\n\nS&P 500 futures: 84.5%\n\nWTI futures: 82.4%\n\n\n\n\n\nForex: 50-week eMA continues to cap dollar gains\n\nThe US dollar index (DXY) closed back beneath its 50-week eMA after a false break above it on Thursday. The daily chart closed with a three-bar reversal pattern (Evening star reversal) thanks to a broad sell-off of the dollar after NFP. The trend remains bullish above 91.51 on the daily chart but it now appears likely to be within a corrective phase.\n\nUSD/JPY formed a long-legged Doji on the weekly chart and a bearish outside day on Friday. With traders increasingly net-short on JY futures we suspect new highs will be on the card once its corrective phase has been completed, but the March 2020 (pandemic) peak has proved a tough level to crack upon its first attempt.\n\nEUR/USD closed back above the June low after a false break, leaving a bullish hammer on the daily chart and suggesting a minor bounce could now be on the cards.\n\nOf all the reversal pattens across FX majors, commodity FX were the most impressive. USD/CAD was the biggest move, falling 0.95% whilst NZD/USD and AUD/USD rallied 0.89% and 0.75% respectively, and all had large outside days.\n\nAUD/USD closed above 0.7500, although take note of the monthly pivot at 7070 which makes a likely resistance level.\n\nAUD/CAD has held above the October 2020 low, so there\u2019s the potential for a corrective bounce form current levels as it has effectively been in a sideways range since early June.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhilst there are similarities between AUD and NZD charts, we\u2019d prefer NZD/USD for counter-trend longs over the near-term. AUD/NZD is drifting lower (which shows NZD is outperforming AUD) and NZD/USD has done a better job at standing up to dollar strength on recent weeks.\n\nNote the false break for NZD/USD of its April low in June, and prices held above that false break last week (unlike AUD). Therefore, our bias is bullish above Friday\u2019s low and would welcome any low-volatility dips within Friday\u2019s range as it may help increase potential reward to risk ratio for retest of the June 25th high. Still, it has to conquer the 200-day eMA so we could expect some notice around current levels, but the initial target is the weekly R1 pivot, just beneath 0.7100.\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn how to trade forex\n\n\n\n\n\nCommodities: Gold considers a break of 1800\n\nGold rallied for a third day and came close to testing 1800, closing the week with a (relatively small) bullish pinbar. With the dollar showing signs of a corrective phase, then perhaps we will see gold back above 1800. And there\u2019s also the fact that prices are holding above trendline support (projected from the May 2019 low) after a particularly bearish month in June \u2013 so a retracement could be expected from those factors alone. A break above 1800 is the next key level for bulls to break which opens-up a clear run for 1860.\n\nWTI trades around 75.25 ahead of today\u2019s OPEC+ meeting. Should they fail to increase production by any meaningful amount then it could be headed for the October 2018 high of 76.90.\n\n\n\n\n\nUp Next (Times in AEST)\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can view all the scheduled events for today using our economic calendar, and keep up to date with the latest market news and analysis here."}, {"headline": "Focus Might Turns to Euro Selling While Dollar Rally Capped by Strong Risk Appetite", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Action Forex", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://www.actionforex.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/f-eur9-e1600272705134.jpg", "author": [], "body": "Dollar ended as the strongest one last week but Friday\u2019s steel fall after solid non-farm payroll job reports suggests that it\u2019s rally is already losing steam. It\u2019s still a bit early to call a bearish reversal for the greenback. Yet, strong risk-on sentiments could cap Dollar\u2019s upside attempts ahead, and even trigger a deeper pull back.\n\nEuro ended as the second weakest, next to Aussie, but the late development in EUR/AUD suggests that the favor is not on Euro\u2019s side. More importantly, developments in some crosses like EUR/CHF and EUR/CAD indicates that market focuses might turn to selling in Euro in crosses ahead. On the other hand, the late rebound in Canadian Dollar opens up some upside prospects for the near term.\n\nNASDAQ closed at new record, heading to 15k handle\n\nNASDAQ\u2019s up trend continued last wee after some hesitation, and finished with a strong close at new record high of 14639.32. Near term outlook will remain bullish as long as 14439.90 supports. Next target is 61.8% projection of 10822.57 to 14175.11 from 13002.53 at 15074.39.\n\nThat would be an important level to overcome as it\u2019s firstly close to 15k handle. More importantly, a strong break of 15k could put weekly MACD back into a rising track. That would in turn argues that NASDAQ is back in medium term up side acceleration. Strong break of 15k would set the stage for even more powerful rise in this 2H of the year.\n\nDOW to catch to resume record run.\n\nDOW also made some notable progress even though it\u2019s still lagging behind S&P 500 and NASDAQ. Current development argues that consolidation pattern from 35091.56 has already completed at 33271.93, after brief breach of medium term channel support.\n\nDOW could take on 35091.56 record high this week, and break will confirm resumption of larger up trend from 18213.65. Next target would be 100% projection of 18213.65 to 2919935 from 26143.77 at 37129.47.\n\nDollar index failed to extend rally, but more upside still mildly in favor\n\nDollar\u2019s development was rather disappointing, as it reacted more to strong risk-on sentiments much more than the solid NFP report. It\u2019s still too early to call an end to the rise from 89.53 as long as 91.51 support holds. Further rally would still be seen to 93.43 resistance and possibly above.\n\nBut we\u2019d maintain that rise from 89.53 is seen as the third leg of the consolidation pattern from 89.20. Hence, we\u2019d expect strong resistance from 38.2% retracement of 102.99 to 89.20 at 94.46 at 94.46. to limit upside, at least to extend sideway trading. Break of 91.51 will suggest that such rise has completed prematurely, and bring retest of 89.20/53 support zone.\n\nEUR/CHF and EUR/CAD turn weaker, more downside ahead\n\nEuro turned notably weaker in some crosses last week. In particular, EUR/CHF\u2019s break of 1.0939 support argues that rebound from 1.0863 has completed at 1.0985 already. It\u2019s also kept below medium term channel resistance, and struggled to sustain above 55 day EMA. The development argues that choppy decline from 1.1149 is still in progress.\n\nDeeper fall is not in favor for the near term to retest 1.0863 support first. Break will resume the fall from 1.1149 to cluster support level at 1.0737, 61.8% retracement of 1.0505 to 1.1149 at 1.0751.\n\nEUR/CAD also dropped notably on Friday and deeper fall is now in favor this week to retest 1.4580 support. The failure to sustain above falling 55 day EMA keeps near term outlook bearish. Break of 1.14580 will confirm resumption of larger decline from 1.5978 and target 61.8% projection of 1.5783 to 1.4723 from 1.5191 at 1.4536. Firm break there could bring further downside acceleration to 1.4263 long term support next.\n\nCanadian Dollar has some upside prospect ahead\n\nOn the other hand, Canadian Dollar has the prospect of turning stronger, with help from persistently strong oil price, BoC tapering expectation. But that would be subject to the upcoming employment data this week. Anyway, AUD/CAD\u2019s breach of 0.9258 support argues that larger fall from 0.9991 is resuming. Focus is back on 0.9247 key cluster support level (38.2% retracement of 0.8058 to 0.9991 at 0.9253).\n\nSustained break of 0.9247/53 will bring some downside re-acceleration to 61.8% projection of 0.9757 to 0.9258 from 0.9394 at 0.9086. There is prospect of even deeper fall to 61.8% retracement of 0.8058 to 0.9991 at 0.8796. Strong rebound from current level, followed by break of 0.9394 resistance will suggest short term bottoming, and bring turn the fortune between Aussie and Loonie.\n\nAUD/USD Weekly Outlook\n\nAUD/USD edged lower to 0.7443 last week but quickly recovered again. Initial bias is turned neutral this week first. Another fall could still be seen, and break of 0.7443 will resume the whole corrective pattern from 0.8006. But we\u2019d expect strong support from 100% projection of 0.8006 to 0.7530 from 0.7890 at 0.7414 to bring rebound. On the upside, break of 0.7615 resistance will indicate short term bottoming, on bearish divergence condition in 4 hour MACD. Intraday bias will be turned back to the upside for 0.7890/8006 resistance zone.\n\nIn the bigger picture, rise from 0.5506 medium term bottom could either be the start of a long term up trend, or a corrective rise. Reactions to 0.8135 key resistance will reveal which case it is. Rejection by 0.8135 key resistance, followed by firm break of 0.7413 resistance turned support, will favors the latter case. Deeper decline would be seen to 38.2% retracement of 0.5506 to 0.8006 at 0.7051 first.\n\nIn the longer term picture, 0.5506 is a long term bottom, on bullish convergence condition in monthly MACD. Focus is now back on 0.8135 structural resistance. Decisive break there will raise the chance that rise from 0.5506 is an impulsive up trend. Next target should be 61.8% retracement at 0.8950 of 1.1079 to 0.5506 and above. Though, rejection by 0.8135 will keep the case of medium to long term sideway consolidation open."}, {"headline": "Asian Open: The US Dollar Sits Tall Ahead of Nonfarm Payrolls", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "City Index", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "https://www.cityindex.co.uk/~/media/research/global/news-analysis/featured-image/jobs-2.jpg", "author": ["Stonex Financial Ltd", "Matt Simpson"], "body": "Asian Futures:\n\nAustralia's ASX 200 futures flat (0%), the cash market is currently estimated to open at 7,265.60\n\nJapan's Nikkei 225 futures are up 120 points (0.42%), the cash market is currently estimated to open at 28,827.04\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng futures are up 18 points (0.06%), the cash market is currently estimated to open at 28,845.95\n\nUK and Europe:\n\nUK's FTSE 100 index rose 87.69 points (1.25%) to close at 7,125.16\n\nEurope's Euro STOXX 50 index rose 14.59 points (0.36%) to close at 4,078.89\n\nGermany's DAX index rose 72.77 points (0.47%) to close at 15,603.81\n\nFrance's CAC 40 index rose 45.99 points (0.71%) to close at 6,553.82\n\nThursday US Close:\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial rose 131.02 points (0.38%) to close at 34,633.53\n\nThe S&P 500 index rose 22.44 points (0.53%) to close at 4,319.94\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 index rose 5.252 points (0.04%) to close at 14,560.05\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn how to trade indices\n\n\n\n\n\nIndices: S&P hits record high for 6th straight day\n\nAnother day, another set of strong employment data and record highs for the US stock market. Weekly jobless claims continued to fall and now sit at their lowest level since the pandemic began. And, in a separate report, intentions to lay-off staff by firms have hit a 21-year low. That said, the employment component of the ISM manufacturing index contracted to 49.9 from 50.9. But, taken alongside strong ADP beating expectations earlier this week (even if softer than the prior read), it\u2019s not a bad set of data overall ahead of today\u2019s NFP report. But, as Matt Weller points out, some leading indicators point towards a weaker-than expected NFP today which could lead to another disappointment for the highly anticipated release (and take the wind out of sentiment just before the weekend).\n\nThe S&P 500 hit a record high for a sixth consecutive session and rose 0.5%, led by energy, utility and financial sectors.

Let\u2019s hope NFP excels to live up to bullish expectation, or else gains be quickly lost.\n\nUSD/JPY reached our first target in the European session and second target in the US and is now trading slightly lower around 111.50. Its next major resistance levels to conquer are the pandemic and highs at 111.71 and 112.22 (with 112.00 thrown in due to being a round number, of course). If today\u2019s NFP data comes in strong enough it could reach 112.0 quite easily and possibly even 12.22. But, if it disappoints once again, we\u2019d expect prices to close firmly beneath the March 2020 high of 111.70 this week and roll over. Therefore, the March 2020 high is a pivotal level around today\u2019s FP report in our view.\n\nThe British pound was the weakest currency BOE\u2019s governor Andrew Bailey after saying it was important to not overact (ie. raise rates) to rising inflation. GBP/USD broken beneath key support of 1.3784 to an 11-week low and EUR/GBP rose 0.43% to print a bearish outside candle.

In the course of buying and selling cryptocurrencies, a forex broker is typically a financial service company that acts as an intermediary between the trader and the interbank system. While making a transaction between a pair of currencies that are generally made of the ten most traded and liquid currencies including USD, EUR, AUD, and others, traders can initiate and execute a trade using a forex broker and earn profit depending on the current exchange rate.\n\nHow Do Forex Brokers Work?\n\nThe forex broker typically works as an intermediary between you and the interbank system, which is a network of banks that trade with each other daily. The broker will typically offer you a price from the banks and financial institutions through which they have access to forex liquidity.\n\nWhen you start trading with a forex broker and open your first trade, the broker will pass it through the market. They offer you a price for that particular forex pair, typically shown in quote form such as GBP/USD 1.3500/1.3505. Here, the first number is the rate the broker offers you if you want to sell the pair. The second number shows the rate at which you can buy the pair. The difference between the numbers i.e., .0005 or 5 pips is taken as a commission by the broker and is known as the spread.\n\nA broker will typically provide you with a trading platform, which is a software program that can either be downloaded or used via a browser on the web. This is the main platform where you buy and sell currencies, monitor trades, conduct technical analysis, and all related functions of trading. Once the broker executes your order, it can either be a winning or a losing trade, leading to a profit or loss for your trading account.\n\nBest UK Forex Brokers \u2013 Top 10 Reviewed\n\n1. eToro \u2013 Best of the Best Forex Brokers\n\nFounded in 2007, eToro is one of the leading forex brokers worldwide.

The broker should be regulated by a major international regulatory body.\n\nDo\u2019s and Don\u2019t\u2019s\n\nPicking the right forex broker will certainly nudge you in the right direction. However, success in the forex market also depends on your actions. You should thus know what to do and what not to do to minimise losses and maximise profits.\n\nDo:\n\nDevelop a concrete plan: You should always try to develop a concrete plan before you dive into the market. Evaluate your goals and objectives before you cast your first trade. Entering the market without a plan can have disastrous consequences, especially if one trades impulsively.\n\nAlways use stop loss and take profit: It\u2019s always important to sit down and evaluate the amount of profit that you feel is realistically achievable. This extends to the use of stop-loss and take-profit levels. Failure to choose fixed levels for closing your trading position will result in closing trades based on emotion.\n\nResearching the market: Staying on top of the factors that affect the forex market. This can extend to international politics, news regarding financial regulations, and other factors such as wars and natural disasters. Typically you would want to get real-time information on factors that affect the currency pair you\u2019re trading, such as the country\u2019s inflation rates and other economic markers.\n\nDon\u2019t:\n\nDon\u2019t commit money you can\u2019t afford to lose: There is a fine line between trading cautiously and outright gambling. So you should always stay within the budget parameters set. It is very easy to get carried away and end up investing more money than you originally planned in forex trading.\n\nDon\u2019t commit revenge trading: Revenge trading is when you try to make up for losses incurred earlier in the day by impulsively executing trades. Do not fall for this trap as you will end up trading using raw emotion rather than trading rules, leading to more losses. You should rather use take-profit levels to lock your gains once you reach your profit target levels. This will alleviate the temptation for further gains.\n\nDon\u2019t let emotions take over: Human emotions such as greed and fear can lead to impractical trading decisions where you will end up incurring a loss. For instance, fear can lead to traders closing their positions early missing out on profits. Always remember that you should stick to your set plan and exit the market once your target profit level for the day has been achieved.\n\nHow to Begin Trading With Forex Brokers \u2013 eToro Guide\n\n\n\nOnce you have made up your mind about which forex broker to use for trading your preferred forex pairs then all that is left to do is start trading. People with some experience might not get stuck at this point but those individuals who have never tried opening an account with a high-quality forex broker would find it complex.\n\nThe following step-by-guide is supposed to help the latter by explaining the procedure of getting started with the best forex broker.\n\nStep 1: Visit eToro\n\n\n\nAfter you have decided which forex broker to proceed with, the first thing to do is visit their official website and get accustomed to it.

Furthermore, consumer\u2019s outlook on whether jobs are \u2018plentiful\u2019 over \u2018hard to get\u2019 rose to its highest differential since 2000, which could bode well for Friday\u2019s NFP report if that indeed turns out to be the current situation.\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 extended their record highs, with the S&P 500 extending its record for a fourth consecutive session. Yet volatility was low overall with the S&P and Dow Jones rising just 0.3% and the Nasdaq rose 0.33%.\n\nIn Europe equities had a positive start yet failed to hold onto early gains to close effectively flat. The FTSE 100 and CAC printed bearish hammers inside Monday\u2019s bearish ranges, so we are still on guard for a bearish break on the FTSE of Monday\u2019s low.\n\nThe ASX 200 threw a spanner in the works of the symmetrical triangle discussed yesterday, by teasing bears with a downside break yet recovering later in the session to close flat with a bullish pinbar. Considering this is as 10 million Australian\u2019s went into lockdown then it\u2019s not a bad close at all. As it stands, we would still consider longs with a break above Friday\u2019s high to suggest momentum had realigned with its bullish trend.\n\n\n\n\n\nASX 200 Market Internals:\n\n\n\n\n\nASX 200: 7301.2 (-0.08%), 28 June 2021\n\nInformation Technology (0.65%) was the strongest sector and Materials (-0.68%) was the weakest\n\n8 out of the 11 sectors closed higher\n\n78 (39.20%) stocks advanced, 111 (55.78%) stocks declined\n\n8 hit a new 52-week high, 2 hit a new 52-week low\n\n71.36% of stocks closed above their 200-day average\n\n64.32% of stocks closed above their 50-day average\n\n47.24% of stocks closed above their 20-day average\n\nOutperformers:\n\n+ 5.69% - Metcash Ltd (MTS.AX)\n\n+ 4.96% - Nuix Ltd (NXL.AX)\n\n+ 3.47% - Lynas Rare Earths Ltd (LYC.AX)\n\nUnderperformers:\n\n-5.67% - Collins Foods Ltd (CKF.AX)\n\n-5.18% - Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield SE (URW.AX)\n\n-4.6% - Nufarm Ltd (NUF.AX)\n\n\n\n\n\nForex: Delta outbreaks weighs on commodity FX\n\nThe latest coronavirus outbreak saw the USD and JPY rise on safe-haven flows and weigh on commodity currencies (AUD, CAD and NZD). Commodity currencies were the weakest majors overnight and the weakest month-to-date.\n\nThe Japanese yen was the strongest major as the risk-off sentiment apparent in yesterday\u2019s Asian session spilled over to the European and US ones. The yen was up against all its major peers but made the most ground against the Australian dollar as several states have headed back into lockdown and the Delta variant rose across parts of Asia. AUD/JPY was the biggest mover, shedding -0.8% in line with our bearish bias and its ranges topping near its 10-day ATR and hitting the initial target of 0.8300. Its next support level is 82.76. Strong economic sentiment for Europe lifted EUR/AUD to our near-term bullish target at its 200-day eMA.\n\nThe US dollar index (DXY) moved higher in line with its double bottom breakout, rose to a six-day high and made it around \u00be of its way to the double bottom target at 92.30. USD/CHF stopped just shy of our June high target and GBP/USD came just 14 pips from our initial 1.3800 target. AUD/USD and NZD/USD both closed firmly beneath their 200-day eMA\u2019s after printing prominent highs.\n\n\n\n\n\nUSD/JPY was just -0.1% lower by the close but intraday price action suggests the move to be corrective. Its trend remains bullish overall, and prices are accelerating away from trendline support to show a pickup of momentum. Prices have also retraced for four consecutive days since last week\u2019s high. Moreover, prices have formed a Doji and respected a cluster of support including the monthly R1 and pivot and weekly pivot point and 20-day eMA. Therefore, if prices can break above yesterday\u2019s high without breaking the support zone then bulls could assume momentum is trying to realign with its bullish trend.\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn how to trade forex\n\n\n\n\n\nCommodities: Metals feel the weight of a stronger dollar\n\nGold and silver finally woke up from their small but choppy sideways ranges with downside breaks. Gold fell -1% and broke to a 10-week low before rising back above 1756 support to close around 1760. Silver fell -1.26% and probed the 25.56 low before closing at 25.73.\n\nPlatinum futures fell -3% and accelerated further away from its 200-day eMA after printing a two-bar bearish reversal at the technical milestone on Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUp Next (Times in AEST)\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can view all the scheduled events for today using our economic calendar, and keep up to date with the latest market

Download our new 3Q top trading opportunities guide from the DailyFX Free Trading Guides!\n\nThe Australian Dollar topped against the US Dollar in the first quarter and continued its slow and steady descent in the following three months. The third quarter could look similar, with AUD/USD struggling. That is because it might be weighed down by a combination of a less-dovish Federal Reserve and ongoing developments in China that pose a risk to the currency\u2019s trajectory.\n\nIn the US, the Fed is becoming less dovish. June\u2019s monetary policy announcement showed a consensus for two rate hikes by the end of 2023, perhaps. This also likely implies that a tapering of its balance sheet could come sooner than anticipated. Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of Australia reported that the cash rate may not increase until 2024 at the earliest.\n\nAs such, the yield advantage may go to the US Dollar in the long run as market sentiment momentum likely struggles to achieve the same breakneck pace set throughout most of last year. This is something that the growth-linked Australian Dollar could use to rekindle its upward momentum, and remains an upside factor for AUD/USD.\n\nHowever in China, Australia\u2019s largest trading partner, the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) has already been normalizing monetary policy to a certain extent. The central bank has been draining liquidity for most of this year via open market operations. This is as corporate bond issuance shrunk by the most since 2017 in May.\n\nChina\u2019s government is trying to tackle exuberance in financial markets, expressing concerns over market bubbles and speculation in commodities. The nation is working to release metal reserves in an effort to tame soaring prices, such as what has been seen in copper. Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions between China and Australia are brewing.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Covid-19 breakout, Australia called for an investigation (along with other international communities) into China\u2019s handling of the coronavirus. The latter responded by imposing tariffs on certain Australian products. China also sued Australia over anti-dumping measures at the World Trade Organization towards the end of June.\n\nA combination of a less-dovish Fed, the PBOC\u2019s normalization and deteriorating Sino-Australian tensions risks boding ill for the Aussie Dollar during the third quarter. Due to close trading relationships, economic developments in China often produce a knock-on impact for Australia. Given the sentiment-linked nature of the Aussie Dollar, this does not seem to bode well.\n\nOn the chart below, a custom majors-based Australian Dollar index can be seen aiming lower with the CSI 300 and copper prices. The index averages AUD against USD, EUR, GBP and JPY. Moreover, the momentum between the 3 data series that was seen after March 2020 has been noticeably slowing. More of the same could be ahead.\n\nSee the favorite trades from each DailyFX Analyst for the third quarter.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) highlights a similar dynamic as the indicator establishes a downward trend and sits at its lowest reading in over a year, and it remains to be seen if the decline from February high (0.8007) will turn out to be a correction in the broader trend or a key reversal in market behavior amid the diverging paths between the Fed and RBA.\n\nWith that said, failure to hold above the 50-Week SMA (0.7485) may push AUD/USD towards the former resistance zone around0.7370 (38.2% expansion) to 0.7390 (38.2% expansion), with the next area of interest coming in around 0.7090 (78.6% retracement) to 0.7180 (61.8% retracement).\n\nAUD/JPY Weekly Chart\n\nSource: Trading View\n\nAUD/JPY has outperformed its US counterpart as it climbed to a fresh yearly high (85.80) in May, and the exchange rate may continue to exhibit the bullish price action from earlier this year as it holds above the March low (82.09).\n\nHowever, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) appears to have diverged with price as it failed to push into overbought territory in May, and the oscillator may continue to show the bullish momentum abating as it snaps the upward trend carried over from the previous year.\n\nWith that said, AUD/JPY may face a correction over the coming months as the V-shape recovery from 2020 stalls ahead of the Fibonacci overlap around 86.10 (38.2% retracement) to 86.30 (78.6% expansion), with a close below the 82.40 (50% expansion) region on a weekly timeframe bringing the 79.50 (161.8% expansion) to 80.20 (38.2% expansion) area on the radar.\n\n--- Written by David Song, Currency Strategist\n\nFollow me on Twitter at @DavidJSong"}, {"headline": "The Australian stock market closed higher; S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.59% from Investing.com", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "QNT", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXNPEC4S0H2_L.jpg", "author": ["Agnes Zang", "About The Author"], "body": "\u00a9 Reuters.

Comments from ECB and BoE officials gave Euro and Sterling some support. But they\u2019re not enough to trigger a notable rebound. Meanwhile, commodity currencies turned mixed. European stock indexes are trading in slight black but US futures are mixed.\n\nTechnically, some focuses are turning back to Yen crosses. EUR/JPY would be eyeing 132.68 resistance against, and break could pave the way to retest 134.11 high. AUD/JPY also rebounds after hitting 82.79 and could be heading back to 84.24. Break will resume the rise from 82.11 for retesting 85.78 high. NZD/JPY looks even stronger and break of 78.46 will resume the rise from 76.20 for retesting 80.17 high.\n\nIn Europe, at the time of writing, FTSE is up 0.70%. DAX is up 0.17%. CAC is up 0.44%.

Sustained break there will carry larger bullish implication. Next target is 61.8% projection of 102.58 to 110.95 from 107.47 at 112.64. On the downside, break of 110.41 support is needed to indicate short term topping. Otherwise, outlook will stay bullish in case of retreat.\n\nIn the bigger picture, medium term outlook is staying neutral with 111.71 resistance intact. Though, as notable support was seen from 55 day EMA, rise from 102.58 is mildly in favor to extend higher. Decisive break of 111.71/112.22 resistance will suggest medium term bullish reversal. Rise from 101.18 could then target 118.65 resistance (Dec 2016) and above. However, sustained break of 55 day EMA would revive some medium term bearishness, and open up deep fall to 61.8% retracement of 102.58 to 110.95 at 105.77 and below.\n\nEconomic Indicators Update"}, {"headline": "Patterns: AUD/JPY, CAD/JPY", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "FXStreet", "date": "5 days ago", "image": "https://editorial.fxstreet.com/images/Markets/Currencies/Crosses/AUDJPY/forex-australia-and-japanese-currency-pair-with-calculator-4780678_Large.jpg", "author": [], "body": "AUD/JPY 4H Chart: Could target 82.00\n\nThe Australian Dollar has declined by 1.68% against the Japanese Yen since June 25.

That fall had dragged AUD/USD from well over parity to under 0.75. The rebound initially helped the currency a bit but since 2018 AUD/USD is largely indifferent to commodity prices and follows rate differentials more closely, spending much of last year catching up with the effect of the Fed's move on those. This is now a challenge for AUD bulls, because the RBA seems committed to a strategy of keeping rates down until after the Fed has hiked.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis morning's policy meeting concluded with cautious economic optimism, a mini-tapering of asset purchases to AUD$4 B per week from September onwards (from AUD5 B now), and a suggestion rate hikes aren't likely before 2024.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don't think that the RBA can prevent AUD/USD from rising further if commodity prices remain high, and as the economy recovers from the latest round of lockdowns.

The pound remains firmer on the back of Boris Johnson\u2019s latest plans to remove lockdown restrictions on July 19th but a weaker dollar also helped support the pound.\n\nNZD/USD was the strongest major pair overnight and is less than 20 pips away from hitting our initial 0.7100 target and NZD/JPY rose to a 3-week high. AUD/NZD fell to a 24-day low ahead of the RBA meeting and EUR/NZD broke back beneath trend support for a second day in a row.\n\nThe New Zealand dollar was broadly higher after a strong business outlook report prompted two local banks to bring forward rate-hike expectations to November this year. The NZIER confidence index rose in Q2 to 7 form -13 in Q1 and is its first positive quarter since June 2017.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we take a step back on EUR/NZD, we can see it remains in an established downtrend on the daily chart, price action from the end of Feb appears to be corrective, and momentum has turned lower since failing to hold above its 200-day eMA. Barring particularly strong data from Europe today, it appears likely that EUR/NZD could close beneath trend support to strongly suggest momentum had realigned with its bearish trend. German industrial production, output manufacturing output are released at 07:00 and the ZEW economic sentiment report and eurozone retail sales is scheduled for 10:00. If they are weak on aggregate, it could help EUR/NZD extended its downside due to a divergent theme materialising.\n\nThe RBA kept their rates at 0.1%, not that they were expected to change anyway. But it does plan on a third round of bond buying which will remain at $4 billion per week until at least November. There was certainly no hawkish surprise in today\u2019s meeting, yet neither was it dovish relative to its usual standards of late. AUD/USD had risen to a five-day high on the back of a stronger NZD earlier in the session, yet has so far held onto gains since the meeting. However, RBA\u2019s Governor Dr Philip Lower is set to speak at 07:00 and that may prove to be the more volatile event as the RBA has generally kept forward guidance for public speaking events.\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn how to trade forex\n\n\n\n\n\nCommodities:\n\nGold rose to 1800 overnight thanks to a weaker US dollar. Momentum leading into the level is relatively strong, although several technical levels await ahead between 1804 and 1812 including the 200-day eMA, monthly pivot and weekly R1. So we would take note of any bearish reversal patterns around such levels. Silver is in a similar situation to gold, and its respective resistance levels are between 26.73 and 71.04.\n\nCopper futures rose to a near-three-week high, although we are waiting to see if it will now break above 4.4350 to suggest a resumption of its long-term bull trend or form a reversal pattern at or around that level. Also take note of trend resistance from the May high which could cap as resistance.\n\nOil prices continued to trade higher after OPEC+ members were unable to agree on the level of output. WTI rose over 2% and is on the cusp of testing its October 2018 peak, brent is up 0.95%.\n\n\n\n\n\nUp Next (Times in BST)\n\nYou can view all the scheduled events for today using our economic calendar, and keep up to date with the latest market news and analysis here.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to trade with City Index\n\nFollow these easy steps to start trading with City Index today:\n\nOpen a City Index account, or log-in if you\u2019re already a customer.

The hourly chart shows that AUDNZD has seen 2 straight up hours. Regarding the trend, note that the strongest trend exists on the 100 hour timeframe. Price action traders may also wish to note that we see a doji candlestick pattern on AUDNZD. Given that we see downtrend on the 20 hourly candle timeframe, and that such candlestick patterns often denote reversals, this may be worth noting. Most noteworthy in the world of moving averages on the hourly chart is that the 20 hour moving average has been crossed, so that price is now turning above it. The moving averages on the hourly timeframe suggest a bullishness in price, as the 20, 50, 100 and 200 are all in a bullish alignment \u2014 meaning the shorter durations are above the longer duration averages, implying a sound upward trend.\n\nAUDNZD End of Day Recap\n\nUpdated 00:30 GMT (04:30 EST)\n\nAUDNZD is down 15 pips (0.14%) since the previous day (opening today near 1.06906), marking the 4th consecutive day a decrease has occurred.

As for the alignment of the moving averages, well, it\u2019s a bit mixed up; the 20, 50, 100, and 200 do not progress from largest to smallest, or vice versa. The closest is the 200 day average, which is 32.6 pips away. The clearest trend exists on the 14 day timeframe, which shows price moving down over that time.

Unless Inflation from 1.1 achieves sustainably 2 or 3%. The target fo the 3 year yield at current 0.44 from OCR at 0.10 is only 34 points away. This means many miles away and may never achieve target.\n\nAs stated many times, the RBA and central banks said nothing and wasted time spent to read the new jibberish. AUD/USD moved higher by 50 pips. That's all that counts. The RBA's words of fantasy are worth 50 pips. The RBA's talk of speculative daydreaming and Economics long ago de coupled from the actual market price and movements. Until interest rates come back to real focus again as in pre 2016 markets then de coupling Economics to market price moves will continue long into the future.\n\nAsk this question. Did the RBA or backward RBA previews assist to make an informed trading decision. Of course not nor will future previews earn 1 pip and future RBA meetings will be worth 50 pips. Yet today traders will be inundated with RBA stuff yet it still won't earn 1 pip.\n\nAUD/EUR traded 0.6356 to 0.6389 or 33 pips for its maximum while EUR/AUD traded 83 pips or 17 pips above AUD/EUR's 33 pips. Take AUD/EUR Max of 33 pips and times 2 then EUR/AUD 66 pip price is known in advance of RBA for an easy trade.

It lent some support to the AUD/USD pair to move beyond a 200-day moving average and stalls near 0.7600 resistance. We can expect the continuation of bids in Aussie after RBA\u2019s statement. However, US Dollar can end its correction on Friday, and it can weigh on the Aussie bulls.\n\nQE taper plan by RBA\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia has announced that it will start tapering the quantitative easing program from September. This is because the officials believe that the Australian economy has recovered stronger than expected, and the outlook is positive through the weekly purchased amount.\n\nThe RBA will probably review further in November, and the board will be allowed to respond to the economic conditions at that time. The RBA\u2019s announcement of QE tapering was more hawkish than anticipated. However, RBA has made the purchases in the future more flexible depending on the economic conditions.\n\nHowever, the RBA\u2019s dovish decision (holding policy rates until 2024) has been overshadowed by the hawkish QE policy. RBA said it will hold the cash rates until they reach an inflation target of 2 \u2013 3 per cent. This can weigh on short-term yields in parallel to the RBA\u2019s yield curve control.\n\nThe recent guidance from RBA tells that the bond for April 2024 will retain the yield target at 0.10%. Overall, the Australian Dollar will find more bids in the short term. It seems like the asset is already undervalued in the context of yield spreads and current fundamental factors.\n\nAUD/USD technical view: Will bulls hold or retrace?\n\nAlthough the pair found bids after the RBA meeting, AUD/USD has pared off gains coming back to the 200-day moving average.\n\nOn the 4-hour chart, the price seems like returning to where it started. However, the recent bar is still bullish. It indicates that the bulls may have run out of steam near the swing high of 0.7600 area.

That fall had dragged AUD/USD from well over parity to under 0.75. The rebound initially helped the currency a bit but since 2018 AUD/USD is largely indifferent to commodity prices and follows rate differentials more closely, spending much of last year catching up with the effect of the Fed's move on those. This is now a challenge for AUD bulls, because the RBA seems committed to a strategy of keeping rates down until after the Fed has hiked.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis morning's policy meeting concluded with cautious economic optimism, a mini-tapering of asset purchases to AUD$4 B per week from September onwards (from AUD5 B now), and a suggestion rate hikes aren't likely before 2024.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don't think that the RBA can prevent AUD/USD from rising further if commodity prices remain high, and as the economy recovers from the latest round of lockdowns.

In the European session, AUD/USD is trading at 0.7581, up 0.68% on the day.\n\nRBA scales back QE, Aussie jumps\n\nAs expected, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) maintained its monetary policy, including holding interest rates at a record low 0.10% for an eighth straight month. The RBA also decided that the timing was right for a trim to its QE programme, which ends in September. The central bank announced that it would reduce QE purchases from AUD 5 billion per week to 4 billion per week, with this move to be reassessed in November.\n\nPredictably, the markets gave a thumbs-up on the news of a QE taper and the Australian dollar jumped on the news \u2013 the currency has risen an impressive 1.0% so far in July. However, some caution is warranted before jumping on the Aussie bandwagon in expectations that the upswing will continue. At today\u2019s policy meeting, the RBA\u2019s forward guidance remained dovish. Policymakers said that the conditions needed to raise rates, including inflation at 2-3% and wage growth of 3% was unlikely to be met prior to 2024.\n\nRBA Governor Lowe acknowledged that economic data had been better than expected, and this was likely the reason that he gave the green light for a taper, even with a resurgence in Covid which has led to lockdowns in much of the country. Lowe was clear in his commitment to monetary stimulus to support the economy, even with the taper, saying that \u201cthe board remains committed to maintaining highly supportive monetary conditions to support a return to full employment in Australia and inflation consistent with the target\u201d.\n\nThe RBA\u2019s message to the markets is that the economy\u2019s performance warrants a slight tightening in policy, but stimulus is still required until inflation and employment targets have been met.\n\n.\n\nAUD/USD Technical\n\nAUD/USD put strong pressure on 0.7604 in the Asian session before retreating. The next resistance line is 0.7681\n\nOn the downside, 0.7447 has some breathing room in support, with AUD/USD rising sharply.

You can exploit these levels or zones by watching the price action that occurs at the given levels.\n\nAUD/USD Analysis\n\nThe AUD has made a very strong recovery since last Friday\u2019s US non-farm payroll data release, after reaching long-term low prices. Although several currencies have advanced against the USD over this period, the AUD has been leading the field. This is probably because the relatively strong new jobs data has boosted risk appetite in the markets, with the AUD seen as a leading \u201crisk\u201d currency.\n\nTechnically, we see a lot of clear support levels below the current price, which are quite tightly packed all the way down to the big round number at 0.7500. This suggests that it would be very difficult for the price to fall quickly by much from its current level.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia left its cash rate unchanged and signaled an unchanging monetary policy earlier, but there are beginning to be hints that the big QE operation will begin to be tapered. In any case, this event does not seem to have had much direct impact upon the AUD, so it seems that the price here is being driven mostly by other factors right now.\n\nIt seems likely that we will see a short-term bearish retracement right now, maybe to the support level at 0.7548 or the half number just above it at 0.7550. I think this would be a natural price movement, with the key thing to watch then becoming whether 0.7548 holds up.\n\nA long trade from a bullish bounce there later today could be an attractive trade.\n\nRegarding the USD, there will be a release of ISM Services PMI data at 3pm London time. There is nothing of high importance scheduled today concerning the AUD."}, {"headline": "AUD/USD Outlook: Aussie Extends Recovery Despite Dovish Signals From RBA Policy Meeting", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Action Forex", "date": "1 hour ago", "image": "https://www.actionforex.com/wp-content/uploads/featured-images/f-aud10.jpg", "author": ["Windsor Brokers Ltd", "Http", "Www.Windsorbrokers.Com", "The Information Contained In This Document Was Obtained Sources Believed To Be Reliable", "But Its Accuracy Or Completeness Cannot Be Guaranteed.

was heading towards a critical Wyckoff level, as BTC price movement piqued traders\u2019 interest in an altcoin rally.\n\nBTC/USD was up 4.6% on Tuesday, according to data from TradingView, compared

The bearish trend-line drew downward to pose a resistant mark on the buy signal side of the 14-day SMA trend-line underneath the 50-day SMA indicator. The critical support baseline remains validly drawn at $30,000. The Stochastic Oscillators are swinging around the value of $35,000 to affirm that the point is vital in determining the real next direction of the market.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the BTC/USD market operation holds close to $35,000, how long will it be?\n\nIt may take a while that the BTC/USD market operation holds close further to $35,000 until the subsequent sessions. A fearful breakout of the point is needed so that bulls will be able to build energy on. Trading psychology in regards to this crypto-economy; supports that some of the downward reversal moves made underneath the level earlier mentioned will most likely pave ways for continual buying entries. Like wisely, investors could as well play along.\n\n\n\nOn the downside, in a familiar style similar trading of the upside, a fake pull-up against the line of $35,000 is needed by bears to get back a decent sell around the point. But, traders of that trading opinion needed to be wary of their positions below the point repeatedly stated in this analysis. Thought, the staying of the Stochastic Oscillators around the range of 80 closely into the overbought region suggests that a downward force may feature if they consolidate any longer around it.\n\n\n\nBTC/USD 4-hour Chart\n\nIt appears on the BTC/USD 4-hour chart that operation holds close to the bearish trend-line drew downward over the SMAs. The 50-day SMA indicator has conjoined from below by the 14-day SMA trend-line between the levels of $36,000 and $32,000. The medium-term run of the BTC/USD market operation has some weeks\u2019 sessions been featuring around those trading points. The Stochastic Oscillators have moved northbound from the oversold region, slantingly pointing toward the upside. That portends a slight weakness in the crypto\u2019s capacity to push upward more as of writing.\n\nLooking to buy or trade Bitcoin (BTC) now?

On June 25 and 29, Bitcoin was repelled as buyers attempt to push BTC price above the $35,000 resistance level. The bears have had the upper hand over the bulls as Bitcoin is confined below the $35,000 resistance level.

Despite the good developments surrounding its space, ETH faced pressure in the market and remained depressed on Monday. In the history of crypto space, it was reported that Ethereum addresses overtook Bitcoin addresses for the first time on Monday. This suggests that the altcoin is becoming far more popular and prominent than the leading cryptocurrency. According to market capitalization, Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world, followed by Bitcoin. But according to data from Bitinfocharts, ETH-based wallet addresses are moving ahead of Bitcoin. The current active addresses of Ethereum amount to 757,859, whereas the addresses of Bitcoin are approximately 50,000. Meanwhile, Ether holders have reportedly staked more than $13 billion worth of the cryptocurrency on the Ethereum 2.0 network, as interest grows. A month earlier, the figure was 5.3 million, and within 30 days, the network users had staked more than 6.1 million in ether. On Monday, the total value of staked ether reached around $13,2 billion.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain, collectively known as Ethereum 2.0, is going through some major changes. The biggest change the upgrade will bring will be a shift from a proof-of-work consensus to a proof-of-stake mechanism. JPMorgan said last week that crypto staking could become a $40 billion industry by 2025, thanks in large part to the changes to the Ethereum network, which will expand the market massively.\n\nFurthermore, Ernest & Young\u2019s attempts to promote secure and private transactions over public blockchains at cheaper costs ended in the release of Nightfall 3. The company announced the news and stated that Nightfall 3 combines zero-knowledge proofs with optimistic rollups to improve transaction efficiency on Ethereum. The zk-rollups are considered one of the layer-two scaling solutions to attain scalability for networks like Ethereum. The announcement also revealed that Nightfall 3\u2019s zk-Optimistic Rollups solution could bring almost 90% in terms of gas fee reductions associated with public ERC-20 token transfers. Furthermore, a 77-year-old woman in Indiana has reportedly become the latest victim of a cryptocurrency scam. She has lost approximately $12,000 to digital scammers who called her explaining that $500 had been removed from her account through a cyberattack. The woman was provided with a number to call. She was instructed to buy $3500 in Bbitcoin from Coinbase. The man on the other side offered the woman help through the buying process and got access to her smartphone and checking account. After that, a total of $12,300 was removed from her checking account. This news also put added pressure on the BTC/USD on Monday. On the other hand, the Bitcoin mining company, Marathon Digital Holdings, recently revealed that the company mined about 265.6 Bitcoin in June alone. The total amount for the whole second quarter is 654.3 Bitcoins, out of which 265.6 were mined in a single month only. June\u2019s mining was 17% higher than the mining done in May. Furthermore, a Dubai-based investment company named IBC Group has reportedly announced that it will end its Bitcoin and Ether mining operations in China. The decision came in after China banned the mining of cryptocurrencies in different provinces across the country. IBC Group has major mining facilities in China, and it has plans to distribute its operations to the UAE, Canada, the USA, Kazakhstan, Iceland and various South American countries. Recently, the group relocated its headquarters to Toronto, Canada. Moreover, Pham Minh Chinh, the Prime Minister of Vietnam, has asked the State Bank of Vietnam to start working on a pilot project for a cryptocurrency. The blockchain-based project is expected to be completed between 2021 and 2023. The PM has taken the initiative as a development strategy towards a digital economy.

Because of this, the market then could go much lower if we break down below the $30,000 level.\n\nBreaking down below the $30,000 level opens up the possibility of a move down to $20,000, based upon the consolidation area that we are in being $10,000 \u201ctall.\u201d With this, you can also make an argument that if we break above the $40,000 level, the market is likely to go looking towards the $50,000 level based upon that same measurement.

Now the question is whether or not we can continue to hold in this area, or if we will continue a move to the downside. I think that because the last couple of weeks have really struggled to get to the top of the consolidation, we will more likely than not see this market break down rather significantly. With that in mind, I like the idea of shorting this market on the breakdown, and I believe at this point in time we will eventually get the opportunity to start selling. In general, this is a market that I think will continue to see a lot of noisy behavior, so if you are looking for a bigger move, you probably have to wait a significant amount of time to get there.

These customers then provide their services to other companies. Therefore, while the hack has affected 40 of the 30,000 Kaseya customers, the impact has been significant. According to the Wall Street Journal, the hackers have demanded north of $70,000,000 in ransom. This is the biggest ransom ever asked.\n\nTherefore, as the number of ransomware attacks increases, there is a possibility that regulators and policymakers in the United States will intervene. Such strict regulations will likely have a negative impact on cryptocurrencies. Still, some analysts believe that regulations will be better for Bitcoin and other genuine cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe BTC/USD is also reacting to news that retail and institutional demand for the coins is falling. Recent data shows that the number of active Bitcoin wallets has declined by double digits and are at the lowest they have been in the past two months. This on-chain data is usually a sign that demand for the coin is easing as its price remains more than 50% below its all-time high. Institutional investors who are important for its adaption have stayed in the sidelines also because of ESG concerns.\n\nBTC/USD Technical Analysis\n\nThe 30-minute chart shows that the BTC/USD has been in a consolidation phase recently.

Further, the Average True Range (ATR) has also dropped.\n\nMeanwhile, the coin is slightly below the first support of the Andrews Pitchfork indicator and is at the same level as the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level.

BTC could decline further if it stays below $34,400.\n\nBitcoin started a downside correction below the $35,000 and $34,000 levels.\n\nThe price is now trading below the $34,000 support and the 100 hourly simple moving average.\n\nThere is a key contracting triangle forming with support near $33,600 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken).\n\nThe pair could decline further if it breaks the $33,600 and $33,500 support levels.\n\nBitcoin Price Remains At Risk\n\nBitcoin failed to climb above the $36,000 zone and it is started a fresh decline. BTC traded below the $35,000 and $34,500 support levels to move into a bearish zone.\n\nThe price even broke the $34,000 level and settled below the 100 hourly simple moving average. A low was formed near $33,103 and the price is now consolidating losses. It recovered above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $35,950 swing high to $33,100 low.\n\nIt seems like there is a key contracting triangle forming with support near $33,600 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. If bitcoin price fails to stay above the triangle support and then $33,500, there is a risk of a downside break.\n\nThe next major support is near the $33,00 level. If there is a downside break below the $33,100 and $33,000 support levels, the price could continue to move down.\n\nIn the stated case, the price might decline towards the $32,500 zone. Any more losses may possibly push the price towards the $32,200 support. The next major supports sits near the $31,200 level.\n\nFresh Increase in BTC?\n\nIf bitcoin remains stable above the $33,500 support zone, it could start a fresh increase in the near term. An immediate resistance on the upside is near the $34,000 level and the triangle upper trend line.\n\nThe next key resistance is near $34,250 and the 100 hourly SMA. The main resistance is now forming near $34,400, above which the price could revisit the $36,000 barrier. Any more gains could lift the price towards the $37,000 resistance.\n\nTechnical indicators:\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD is slowly losing pace in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \u2013 The RSI for BTC/USD is just below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Levels \u2013 $33,500, followed by $33,000.\n\nMajor Resistance Levels \u2013 $34,000, $34,400 and $35,000."}, {"headline": "Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow Model, Rooted in \u2018Hard Money\u2019 Narrative, Goes Off Course", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "Yahoo Finance", "date": "13 hours ago", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/21be_OprlLDtv57kqrKZuA--~B/aD03MTU7dz0xMzAwO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/coindesk_75/8c48cd6e05bfdf90ece40a07d8e53494", "author": ["Lyllah Ledesma"], "body": "One of the most widely used charts for predicting massive future bitcoin price gains is showing the largest divergence since January 2019.\n\nThe bitcoin stock-to-flow model currently suggests that the price of bitcoin should be around $77,900. But as of Monday, the cryptocurrency was trading at $33,668, well off the all-time high price of $64,829 reached in April.\n\nCrypto analyst \u2018PlanB\u2019, who has been documenting his stock-to-flow model since March 2019, tweeted that BTC/USD is now the furthest away from the estimated value in more than two years.\n\nRelated: UBS Says Regulatory Crackdown Could Pop \u2018Bubble-Like Crypto Markets\u2019: Report\n\nHe said that the next six months will \u201cmake or break\u201d the stock-to-flow model.\n\nThe stock-to-flow model is generally applied to natural resources like gold or silver. The commodities are often referred to as \u201cstore of value\u201d resources that, in theory, should retain their value over the long term due to their scarcity and low flow.\n\nThe idea is that low supply makes the metals more like \u201chard money\u201d \u2013 contrasted with the dollar. This is an especially harsh juxtaposition as the Federal Reserve has printed more than $4 trillion of fresh dollars since the coronavirus pandemic hit in March 2020; that\u2019s the same amount the U.S. central bank had previously created since it was established early last century.\n\nBitcoin, sometimes touted by proponents as \u201cdigital gold,\u201d is treated as if it were a scarce commodity for the purposes of the model. Bitcoin is costly to produce and considered scarce, as its maximum supply is capped at 21 million coins.\n\nRelated: Brazil\u2019s Bitcoin Banco Group and Leader Arrested for Alleged Embezzlement of $300M in Crypto\n\nThe cryptocurrency also undergoes \u201cbitcoin halvings\u201d where the number of bitcoins entering the system with every new data block \u2013 every 10 minutes or so on average \u2013 gets cut in half. These halvings take place roughly every four years.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cBitcoin has limited supply, which is great and well known,\u201d said Charles Morris, founder of ByteTree Asset Management. \u201cAs supply is cemented, the price can only be driven by demand.\u201d\n\nIn the past, the bitcoin stock-to-flow model has been used to forecast future BTC price action. Pantera Capital, a hedge fund that specializes in cryptocurrencies, predicted in April 2020 that bitcoin could rise to $115,000 by August this year, using this model.\n\nPlanB wrote in a blog post in April 2020 that the price of bitcoin could hit $288,000 by 2024, citing the stock-to-flow model.\n\n\u201cAccording to the model\u2019s projections, bitcoin\u2019s price should see a significant increase over time due to its continually reduced stock-to-flow ratio,\u201d said Binance Academy in a blog post.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the model relies heavily on the assumption that the scarcity of the cryptocurrency should drive value, which might not always be the case. That\u2019s especially true because of the notoriously volatile short-term swings in the bitcoin price.\n\n\u201cThe stock-to-flow model was created on the back of two halving events,\u201d Morris said. \u201cI agree, with some caution, that halving may boost the price by roughly 2x, as miner selling pressure halves, but the notion the future price path is assured multiples beyond this is ridiculous.\u201d\n\nRelated Stories"}]}, {"id": "CAD/JPY", "price_data": [87.90699768066406, 87.88999938964844, 87.94000244140625, 87.95999908447266, 88.00900268554688, 88.00599670410156,

US equities notched fresh all-time-highs and US Dollar bears made their mark in the first two months of the quarter, with a notable pullback showing in June around the FOMC rate decision.\n\nBut, it was at that same rate decision that kickstarted a round of US Dollar strength that FOMC Chair, Jerome Powell, said that market participants should take the dot plot matrix and the Fed\u2019s forecasts with a grain of salt. That\u2019s what helped to really propel stocks, and risk assets, as it became clear once again that the world\u2019s largest national central bank is backstopping markets and apparently happy to continue doing so.\n\nThis does create some interesting dynamics elsewhere, however, such as around the Japanese Yen and the Canadian Dollar.\n\nThe Bank of Canada created some surprise in April when they became one of the first globalized central banks to start talking about post-pandemic policy. This led to a strong run of Canadian Dollar strength that was similarly supported by rising oil prices. The Bank of Japan, however, continues to hold negative rates as they have since 2016. And there appears to be little sign of anything changing on that front, even as a potential shift appears ahead of or around the Federal Reserve.\n\nThis has supported a strong trend in CAD/JPY that\u2019s propelled the pair up to fresh three-year-highs. And very nearby is an important watermark, plotted at 91.64 which is the current five-year high in the pair.\n\nCAD/JPY Monthly Price Chart\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; CADJPY on Tradingview\n\nCAD/JPY Bullish Breakout Potential\n\nA big technical item took place in CAD/JPY during the month of May when price action broke above a descending trendline that\u2019s connecting 2018 and 2014 swing highs. This also came along with a test above the psychological 90 level.\n\nThis keeps the door open for bullish breakout potential ahead of the Q3 open, and this can be followed by first looking for a test of the five-year-high plotted at 91.64, after which another interesting spot opens on the chart around 93.25. If buyers can push through here, then the 95.00 psychological level would be the next big spot to follow.\n\nCAD/JPY Weekly Price Chart\n\nChart prepared by James Stanley; CADJPY on Tradingview\n\n--- Written by James Stanley, Senior Strategist for DailyFX.com\n\nContact and follow James on Twitter: @JStanleyFX"}, {"headline": "USD/CAD on the fence ahead of US jobs report", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "Forexlive", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://az705044.vo.msecnd.net/20210702/2-7-2021-6-40-34-pm.png", "author": [], "body": "The loonie is holding its ground in European trading\n\n\n\n\n\nUSD/CAD was up earlier to a high of 1.2449 but is now tracking lower to the lows for the day at 1.2418 as the loonie regains some momentum after a sluggish week against the dollar, despite higher oil prices in the lead up to the OPEC+ decision.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat may tell us quite a bit of how solid the dollar's performance has been and from a technical perspective, it has seen USD/CAD break above 1.2400 and even its 100-day moving average (red line) once again - after having briefly done so in June.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast month, the break against the latter technical level was short-lived as buyers failed to get close to contest the 1.2500 level and so the highs then @ 1.2481-87 offers a key resistance region going into the US jobs report later today.\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the hawkish tilt by the BOC, you'd have to figure that the latest bounce since mid-June owes much to a technical rejection of 1.2000 at its first attempt.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut if the BOC is going to play it slow now that the Fed itself is starting to turn the other cheek, then loonie gains may be less straightforward to come by than it was in the opening five months of the year.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we break back above 1.2500, I can see this heading towards the 200-day moving average (blue line) @ 1.2670 next.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat said, with the BOC likely to push forward with its agenda, the Canadian economy looking more optimistic, and oil prices to stay more upbeat, it is tough to fit the solid fundamental backdrop that is supporting the loonie at the moment.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs mentioned before, on the balance of things, I would argue that USD/CAD is likely headed towards another test of 1.2000 but that conviction isn't what it was pre-FOMC.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe technical element now is also part of the consideration, with dollar gains ahead of the payrolls later adding to the recent upside pressure in the pair.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs such, as mentioned before, there is a stronger argument that this latest shift in the landscape calls for a stronger loonie against the likes of the franc and yen in the long-term, given rate differentials and policy/economic divergence.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut of course, timing is everything so be wary of potential retracements considering how CAD/JPY was already the best performer in 1H 2021."}, {"headline": "CAD/JPY Increases Ahead of International Merchandise Trade Release", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://mlmhhbc485aw.i.optimole.com/ltER-78-JsCXf58R/w:auto/h:auto/q:90/https://fxdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/canadian-dollar-4511616_640.png", "author": ["Usman Ahmed"], "body": "Since the last three days, the Canadian dollar (CAD) has begun to recover against the Japanese yen (JPY).

We bottomed exactly here but the outlook remains negative.\n\nToday\u2019s Analysis\n\nIf USD/JPY fails to hold above 111.00, it risks the formation of a double top sell signal. The pair is edging slowly lower to 110.60/55 and almost as far as first support at 110.30/20. Below 110.00 look for 109.75/65. Gains are likely to be limited with minor resistance at 110.60/70. Strong resistance at 111.00/111.10. A break above 111.20 kills the double top sell signal and is a buy signal initially targeting 111.40/50 then 111.70/80.\n\nWith EUR/JPY, we are short at very strong resistance at 132.50/60 and hitting the next target of 131.25/05 perhaps as far as minor support at 131.10/00 today. A break below the 100 day moving average at 130.90/80 is a sell signal targeting 130.60/50 and 130.20/00. A break below here is a sell signal targeting 129.80 and support at 129.50/40.\n\nGains are likely to be limited with minor resistance at 1.3180/90. Above 132.00, however, allows a recovery towards very strong resistance again at 132.50/60. Shorts need stops above 132.80. A break higher is a buy signal targeting 133.20/30, perhaps as far as 133.55/65.\n\nCAD/JPY is holding strong resistance at 9020/30 and hitting our targets of 8990/80 and 8940/20. Further losses look likely to 8880/70. Gains are likely to be limited with minor resistance at 8955/65. Above 8980, however, allows a recovery towards strong resistance again at 9020/30. A break above 9040 targets 2 week highs at 9070/80.\n\nJPY Chart\n\nDisclaimer: No representation or warranty is made as to the accuracy or completeness of this information and opinions expressed may be subject to change without notice.

But with the labour force rising by just 151,000 and still more than three million below its pre-pandemic peak, we aren\u2019t entirely convinced that this is the start of a much stronger trend,\u201d says Andrew Hunter at independent research and consultancy Capital Economics.\n\n\u201cThe key event next week will be the release of the minutes from the Fed\u2019s June meeting, which are likely to provide more details of discussions about asset purchase tapering,\u201d Hunter adds.\n\nWednesday\u2019s minutes are set to hit the wires hard on the heels of June\u2019s non-farm payrolls report, which showed employment rising by almost 1 million last month and lifted the six-month rolling average of payrolls growth to a robust 481k.\n\nAbove: Pound-to-Dollar rate shown at daily intervals with Fibonacci retracements of Feb-to-June rally indicating support levels, alongside selected moving-averages.\n\nAchieve up to 3-5% more currency for your money transfers.

The calendar is quite light, with the highlight probably being the release of the FOMC minutes on Wednesday evening. Much focus will be given to how the doves and hawks are arguing their cases,\u201d Turner adds.\n\nThe Dollar ended last week on its back foot even after Friday\u2019s payrolls surprise, enabling the Pound-Dollar rate to rise back above a 1.38 handle that had appeared in danger of ceding and potentially indicating the directional bias of the U.S. currency ahead of this Wednesday\u2019s minutes, although it\u2019s the market\u2019s reading of and response to the minutes that will dictate how and where GBP/USD ends the week.\n\nThe risk is that Wednesday\u2019s meeting notes bring attention back to bear on the Fed\u2019s $120 billion per month quantitative easing (QE) programme and questions about what would be the most appropriate time to begin winding it down and the pace at which such an exercise should be carried out; potentially leading to increased bond yields and, or a bid for the Dollar in the latter half of the week.\n\nAbove: Pound-to-Dollar rate shown at daily intervals with Fibonacci retracements of correction from early June highs and key moving-averages indicating possible areas resistance to any recovery.\n\n\u201cThe US fiscal stimulus is by far the largest in G10, helping the US outgrow the rest of the world and likely supporting USD this year and possibly next. The Fed is on track to announce tapering at an upcoming meeting, and we continue to think the September meeting is most likely, with tapering starting at the turn of the year,\u201d says Michalis Rousakis, a strategist at BofA Global Research.\n\n\u201cOur key difference with the consensus is that we expect the USD to rally against currencies of central banks that will not be normalizing policies, including EUR, CHF, JPY and SEK, but not necessarily against the rest. Indeed, this is exactly how G10 FX has performed this year, with CAD, GBP, USD and NOK at the top, JPY, CHF, SEK and EUR at the bottom, and AUD and NZD in the middle,\u201d Rousakis adds.\n\nThe Dollar has been lifted in the last month by a lessening of bearish sentiments toward it which was brought about by evolving expectations for Fed policy, with investors and traders increasingly wagering that the bank could raise its interest rate before the end of next year, before lifting it back to 1% by the end of 2023 even as Chairman Jerome Powell poured cold water over other policymakers\u2019 suggestions that any changes to interest rates are in any way likely within this time period.\n\nAbove: Goldman Sachs graph showing market expectations for changes in major central bank policy rats (BoE in red).\n\n\u201cThere are still a number of open questions around the Fed\u2019s balance sheet, including the taper announcement timeline, the duration of the tapering process, and whether the committee will rule out rate hikes while the balance sheet is still growing,\u201d says Zach Pandl, co-head of global foreign exchange strategy at Goldman Sachs.\n\nProspects for U.S. interest rates have dominated the market conversation even as Chairman Powell and others made clear in June that the Fed\u2019s policy priority is the government bond buying programme and its eventual, gradual winding down, details of which may or may not be revealed by Wednesday\u2019s meeting minutes: To the extent that these do reveal anything about the likely timing of a decision by the Fed to reduce its footprint in the U.S. government bond market they will determine whether the Pound-Dollar rate holds onto or gives up the 1.38 handle ahead of Friday\u2019s GDP report.\n\n\u201cMinutes from the June 15-16 FOMC meeting, released on Wednesday, may help clarify Fed officials\u2019 views on the exit path.

The advance is expected to be limited given the overall lack of yield support with gains concentrated against the Euro, yen and Swiss franc.\n\nThe bank expects relatively narrow ranges will prevail in global exchange rates.\n\nUS Dollar Advance against Low-Yield Currencies\n\nBNP Paribas expects that a stronger global economy will be a key driver of exchange rates over the second half of 2021.\n\nAs far as the dollar is concerned, the bank expects that the Federal Reserve will take a measured step towards policy tightening, especially with strong US demand.\n\n\u201cAs the US recovery proceeds and the Fed gets closer to reducing policy accommodation, we expect US real yields to edge up.\u201d\n\nBNP expects that the increase in yields will provide an element of dollar support, but the absolute level of yields will remain relatively unattractive. In this environment, the dollar gains are likely to be concentrated against currencies where central banks will be even slower to tighten monetary policy.\n\nBNP looks at longer-term trends from economic cycles and notes that the dollar tends to strengthen ahead of Federal Reserve interest rate increases before weakening once rates actually increase.\n\n\u201cUSD gains are likely to be most pronounced versus currencies where the market cannot price a meaningful exit from easy monetary policy, notably the CHF, JPY and EUR.\u201d\n\nThe Euro to Dollar (EUR/USD) exchange rate is forecast to weaken to 1.1400 at the end of 2022.\n\nExport Earnings Boost Commodity Currencies\n\nAs the global economy tends to normalise, BNP expects there will be investor support for currencies where there are strong commodity earnings or interest rates are expected to increase.\n\n\u201cIn contrast, we expect a number of emerging market and G10 currencies with commodity exposure or where central banks are likely to hike in tandem with \u2013 or ahead of \u2013 the Fed to hold up well and even outperform the USD.\u201d\n\nIn this context, it expects that commodity currencies will maintain a firm tone and hold their own against the US currency.\n\nPound Sterling (GBP) Exchange Rates Remain Attractive\n\nBNP remains constructive surrounding the Pound Sterling outlook. The bank expects that there is scope for UK yields to increase further as the Bank of England is likely to be one of the early movers in removing policy accommodation.\n\n\u201cComparing the market pricing for rate hikes across the G10, the Bank of England looks conservatively priced, especially considering its less-restrictive forward guidance.\u201d\n\nUK assets continued to under-perform in the 2016-2020 period as Brexit uncertainty curb investor inflows. According to BNP, there is scope for a further catch-up effect over the next few months.\n\n\u201cWe also maintain our positive view on UK equities, as these have lagged the broader rotation into Value stocks, and this could benefit the GBP.\u201d\n\nThe Euro to Pound (EUR/GBP) exchange rate is forecast to weaken to 0.83 at the end of 2022.\n\nAbove: Table of currency forecasts from BNP Paribas covering period 2021-2022."}, {"headline": "Exchange rates predict exchange rates: USD/JPY and JPY cross pairs", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "FXStreet", "date": "6 days ago", "image": "https://editorial.fxstreet.com/images/Markets/Currencies/Majors/USDJPY/usdjpy_Large.jpg", "author": [], "body": "For the second instance over the past 4 weeks, all JPY cross pairs are at, near, or broke vital support points.
