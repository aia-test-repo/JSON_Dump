AUDCAD\u2019s rate is up 15 pips (0.16%) from the hour prior. This is a reversal of the price action on the previous hour, in which price moved down. As for the trend on the hourly timeframe, we see the clearest trend on the 20 hour timeframe. The moving averages on the hourly timeframe suggest a choppiness in price, as the are all in a mixed alignment \u2014 meaning the trend across timeframes is inconsistent, indicating a potential opportunity for rangebound traders.\n\nAUDCAD End of Day Recap\n\nUpdated 00:30 GMT (04:30 EST)\n\nAUDCAD is up 47 pips (0.51%) since the day prior (opening today near 0.93639), marking the 2nd straight day an increase has occurred. Compared to its peers in the Forex, AUDCAD gave its buyers a return that ranked 6th in terms of percentage change since the day prior. Let\u2019s take a look at price chart of AUDCAD.\n\nAUDCAD Technical Analysis\n\nFirst things first: AUDCAD crossed above its 20 and 50 day moving averages yesterday. Trend traders will want to observe that the strongest trend appears on the 90 day horizon; over that time period, price has been moving down. Or to simplify this another way, note that out of the past 30 days AUDCAD\u2019s price has gone down 18 them.\n\nThe View From Around the Web\n\nNot much in terms quality buy/sell signals we\u2019re seeing for AUDCAD; just 1 sell signals and 1 buy signals. This imputes a buy/sell ratio of 1, which is neutral. As for the rationale, technical traders seem to be citing the appearance of demand zone technical patterns.

In New Zealand, the appeared more hawkish than expected, sending the sharply higher. Today, investors are likely focus on Fed Chair Powell\u2019s testimony before Congress, as well as on the monetary policy decision.\n\nUS Dollar Rallies, Equities Pull Back On Rising US CPIs, Powell Appears Before Congress\n\nThe US dollar traded higher against all but one of the other major currencies on Tuesday and during the Asian morning Wednesday. It lost ground only against NZD, while it gained the most versus , , and . The greenback eked out the least gains versus .\n\n\n\nUSD performance major currencies\n\nMajor global stock indices performance\n\nFed funds futures market expectations on US interest rates\n\nThe strengthening of the US dollar and the Japanese yen, combined with the weakening of the risk-linked , suggests that markets turned to risk-off at some point yesterday or today in Asia. The Kiwi\u2019s rally points otherwise, but we already know that this was the result of the RBNZ decision overnight rather than the broader market sentiment. Looking at the performance in the equity world, we see that indeed, sentiment was soft during the EU trading, and deteriorated even further during the US and Asian sessions, despite the and hitting fresh records in early trading.In our view, this was due to the US CPIs accelerating by more than anticipated, with the rate rising to a 13-year high and the one hitting its highest level since November 1991. This may have added to concerns that the inflation spike may eventually not be due to transitory factors and prompted market participants to bring forth their bets over when the Fed may start raising interest rates. Ahead of the CPIs, expectations were for the Committee to push the hike button in March 2023, but now, such a move is nearly fully priced in for January 2023.Today, investors are likely to lock their gaze on Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s testimony to Congress on the state of the US economy. They may be eager to find out whether their pricing is correct or not. Although we know from the latest \u201cdot plot\u201d that the consensus among officials is for rates to start rising in 2023, market participants may be looking for clues as to when this could happen as early as in January, as their bets suggest.\n\nAnother point of interest may be any clues and hints over when policymakers are planning to start reducing their bond purchases. With the minutes of the last gathering emphasizing on a divided Committee, Powell may provide more clarity on where the majority stands. In case we get remarks suggesting that this could happen in the next few months, the US dollar is likely to continue to drift north, while equities may correct a bit lower. However, as we already noted yesterday and on Monday, stock-market investors may also keep an eye on second-quarter earnings, and thus, we would treat any further decline in stock indices during Powell\u2019s speech as a corrective setback. Solid earnings may encourage participants to take advantage of any potential setback and push stock prices up again.\n\nS&P 500 Technical Outlook\n\nThe S&P 500 cash index traded lower yesterday, after hitting a fresh record high at 4392.10. That said, the price remains above the upside support line drawn from the low of June 21, and thus, we would still consider the short-term picture somewhat positive, even if there is room for some further correction.\n\nYes, the index may continue drifting south for a while more, especially if Powell appears hawkish when he testifies before Congress later in the day. However, market participants may jump into the index near the aforementioned upside line and aim for another test near the record of 4392.10, or the psychological round figure of 4400. If they don\u2019t stop there, then we could see them climbing towards the 4450 territory.\n\nOn the downside, we would like to see a dip below 4330 before we abandon the bullish case. This may also confirm the break below the upside line drawn from the low of June 21, and perhaps allow declines towards the 4290 territory, near the low of July 8.Another break, below 4290, could extend the slide towards the 4260 barrier, which is slightly below the low of June 25, and fractionally above the inside swing high of June 23.\n\n\n\nS&P 500 cash index 4-horu chart technical analysis\n\nRBNZ Appears More Hawkish Than Expected, BoC Takes Its Turn\n\nNow, flying form the US to New Zealand, overnight we had an RBNZ monetary policy decision. The Bank kept interest rates unchanged at +0.25%, and although we have been expecting an optimistic language, the statement was even more hawkish than what we (and apparently many other market participant) have been anticipating. Officials announced that they will end their Large-Scale Asset Purchase (LSAP) program from next week. This sent the Kiwi sharply higher, taking it to the first place on the performance table of the major currencies.\n\n\n\nRBNZ interest rates New Zealand\n\nNow, bearing in mind that expectations around the Fed\u2019s future plans may keep any future Kiwi gains limited against the US dollar, we prefer to exploit such gains against the Aussie. First of all, any impact due to the broader market sentiment will be offset, as both currencies are affected the same way.\n\nSecond, last week, the RBA announced that it will proceed with more bond purchases, beyond September, which could keep the Aussie in a more vulnerable position than the Kiwi. Long story short, we do expect to continue drifting south for a while more.\n\nLater in the day, the central bank torch will be passed to the BoC. When they last met, policymakers of this Bank kept their monetary policy settings unchanged but noted that any adjustments to the pace of their QE purchases will be guided by the ongoing assessment of the strength and durability of the economic recovery. In our view, the absence of strong hints with regards to further tapering in the upcoming months may have disappointed some traders, and that\u2019s why the currency traded lower after the decision.\n\n\n\nBoC interest rates\n\nAUD/CAD Technical Outlook\n\nHowever, since then, both the and CPIs accelerated by more than anticipated, while the showed that the Canadian economy added more jobs than expected in June. What\u2019s more important though is that the Bank\u2019s latest Business Outlook Survey indicator rose to a record high, due to a fast vaccination pace and the easing of some covid-related restrictions. In our view, this may allow the Bank to scale back its QE further at this gathering, which, combined with upbeat signals that more tapering is in the works for the months to come, could support the Canadian dollar. Again, we would choose as a counterpart the Aussie, which we expect to have a poorer performance due to a dovish RBA.\n\ntraded lower yesterday, after hitting resistance near 0.9355. Overall though, the pair has been trading in a trendless mode, between 0.9255 and 0.9390 since May 20, and thus, we will take a neutral stance for now. We prefer to wait for the pair to exit the range before we get confident on the next direction.\n\nWith the fundamentals favoring the Canadian dollar, we would see more chances for the pair to exit the range through its lower bound, at 0.9255. This will confirm a forthcoming lower low on the daily chart and may pave the way toward the 0.9200 territory, marked by the inside swing high of May 26, 2020. If that barrier is not able to halt the slide, then we will consider as the next possible resistance, the 0.9130 level, marked by the low of May 29, 2020.\n\nNow, in case we do see a strong recovery and the rate exiting the sideways range through its upper bound, at 0.9390, we would start examining the bullish case. The buyers may then get encouraged to push the action towards the peak of May 14, at 0.9430, the break of which could trigger extensions towards the 0.9470 area, marked by the inside swing lows of May 10 and 11. The next resistance may be the psychological figure of 0.9500, which is very close to the high of May 11.\n\n\n\nAUD/CAD 4-hour chart technical analysis\n\nAs For The Rest Of Today's Events\n\nDuring the early EU session, we already got the UK CPIs for June. Both the and rates rose more than expected, but the pound gained only somewhat, perhaps because, at its latest , the BoE insisted that the spike in inflation is likely to prove to be transitory and added that they do not want to undermine the recovery by premature tightening.\n\nA few hours later, we have Eurozone\u2019s for May, while during the US session, the US s for June are coming out. Eurozone\u2019s industrial production is expected to have weakened 0.1% mom after improving 0.8% in April, while both the headline and US PPI rates are expected to have risen further.\n\nOn Thursday, during the Asian session, the main items on the agenda may be Australia\u2019s report for June, as well as China\u2019s for Q2, which will be accompanied by the , , and , all for June. In Australia, the is forecast to have ticked down to 5.0% from 5.1%, but the net change in employment is expected to show that the economy has gained less jobs than in May. Specifically, it is expected to show a 30.0k jobs gain following 115.2k new jobs in May.\n\n\n\nAustralia unemployment rate\n\nWith the RBA still wearing its dovish dress, we don\u2019t believe that the anticipated slide in the unemployment rate will be enough to spark speculation that Australian policymakers will turn in the direction of the more hawkish Fed, RBNZ and BoC in the months to come, especially with the employment growth slowing down.\n\nAs for the Chinese data, the GDP is expected to have accelerated to +1.3% qoq from +0.6%, while fixed asset investment is anticipated to have slowed to +12.5% yoy from 15.4%. Industrial production and retail sales are expected to have slowed as well, to +7.9% yoy and +11.0% yoy from +8.8% and +12.4% respectively. In our view, despite expectations of some slowdown during the last month of the quarter, it seems that the world\u2019s second largest economy has performed very well during the whole period and thus, we don\u2019t expect this data series to have a major impact on investors\u2019 morale."}, {"headline": "Weekly Outlook: RBNZ, BoC, and BoJ Decisions; US Inflation Data", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Investing.com", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/redesign/images/seo/investingcom_analysis_og.jpg", "author": [], "body": "Following the last week, we have three more central banks deciding on monetary policy this week: the , the and the . We expect the RBNZ and the BoC to be dressed in hawkish colors, with the latter perhaps tapering its bond purchase further, even as soon as this week. That said, with both the Japanese and rates near zero, the BoJ is likely to maintain a dovish approach. The US CPIs are also on this week\u2019s agenda, and they may well shape expectations around the Fed\u2019s future course of action.\n\nMonday appears to be a relatively light day with no major economic releases and events on the agenda.\n\nOn Tuesday, the highlight is likely to be the US CPIs for June. The rate is forecast to have ticked down to +4.9% yoy from +5.0%, while the one is anticipated to have inched up to +4.0% yoy from +3.8%.\n\n\n\nUS CPIs core PCE inflation\n\nUS Fed funds futures market forecasts of the Fed funds rate\n\nAt its latest , the FOMC kept its policy unchanged, but signaled that interest rates are likely to start rising in 2023. Since then, we\u2019ve heard the individual views of several policymakers, with some of them supporting that interest rates should even start rising during 2022, and others arguing against withdrawing monetary policy support too soon. The divided Fed was also reflected in the minutes of the gathering, with various participants feeling that the conditions for reducing their asset purchases would be \u201cmet somewhat earlier than they had anticipated\u201d, while others saw a less clear signal from incoming data and suggested a \u201cpatient\u201d approach to any policy change. Overall though, they generally agreed that it is important to be well positioned to reduce the pace of asset purchases in case there is faster-than-anticipated progress towards the Committee\u2019s goals.In our view, a rising core CPI rate could add more credence to the view that the surge in inflation may eventually not be due to transitory factors and could increase expectations that the Fed may indeed start normalizing its monetary policy sooner than previously thought. According to the Fed fund futures, market participants expect the first rate hike to be delivered in April 2023, but a rising core CPI rate may bring that timing forth and thereby support the . At the same time, equities are likely to correct lower, but we believe that the main focus for equity investors is likely to be second-quarter earnings, with big banks reporting this week. Expectations are for a growth of 65.8% for companies in the , up from a previous forecast of 54% at the start of the period. Solid earnings are likely to encourage more equity buying, and thus, we don\u2019t expect a major pullback in stock indices in case data show that underlying inflation continued to accelerate in the US. We believe that expectations around the Fed\u2019s future course of action may be reflected more in the FX sphere.\n\nAs for the rest of Tuesday\u2019s data, during the Asian session, we have Australia\u2019s index for June and China\u2019s for the same month. Later in the day, ahead of the US CPIs, we get Germany\u2019s final inflation numbers for June, but as it is always the case, they are expected to confirm their preliminary estimates.\n\nOn Wednesday, we have two major central banks deciding on monetary policy, the RBNZ and the BoC. The RBNZ gets the ball rolling during the Asian morning, and although no policy action is expected, the tone of the accompanying statement may play a major role in shaping expectations over the Bank\u2019s policy plans. Last week, market participants brought forth their bets over when this Bank will push the hike button, with 60% of New Zealand\u2019s financial-sector firms expecting interest rates to rise over the coming year. This happened after a closely watched business confidence index jumped to its highest in four years.\n\n\n\nRBNZ interest rates New Zealand\n\nWith all that in mind, investors may dig into the statement for clues and hints on how optimistic policymakers are, and when they may be thinking to start raising rates. Although inflation remains below the midpoint of the Bank\u2019s 1-3% target range, New Zealand has so far avoided a major outbreak of Covid\u2019s Delta mutation, which may allow officials to be more optimistic than previously. This could support the at the time of the announcement, but bearing in mind that FX traders\u2019 sentiment may also be affected by expectations surrounding a potential Fed tightening, we don\u2019t believe an upbeat RBNZ could prove the catalyst for a major trend reversal in NZD/USD. It could just allow the latest corrective recovery to continue for a while more.\n\nLater in the day, the BoC takes its turn. When they last met, policymakers of this Bank kept their monetary policy settings unchanged, but noted that any adjustments to the pace of their QE purchases will be guided by the ongoing assessment of the strength and durability of the economic recovery. In our view, the absence of strong hints with regards to further tapering in the upcoming months may have disappointed some traders, and that\u2019s why the currency traded lower after the decision.\n\n\n\nBank of Canada interest rates\n\nHowever, since then, both the and s accelerated by more than anticipated, while the showed that the Canadian economy added more jobs than expected in June. What\u2019s more important though is that the Bank\u2019s latest indicator rose to a record high, due to a fast vaccination pace and the easing of some covid-related restrictions. In our view, this may allow the Bank to scale back its QE further at this gathering, which, combined with upbeat signals that more tapering is in the works for the months to come, could support the Canadian dollar.\n\nAs for Wednesday\u2019s data, during the early European session, the UK CPIs for June are due to be released. The rate is forecast to have ticked up to +2.2% yoy from +2.1%, while the one is anticipated to have held steady at +2.0% yoy. At its latest , the BoE kept its policy unchanged, with only one member voting in favor of QE tapering. That member was Chief Economist Andy Haldane, for whom that was the last meeting. The Bank repeated that the surge in inflation is expected to be transitory, and added that they do not want to undermine the recovery by premature tightening. With that in mind, we don\u2019t expect inflation staying around the Bank\u2019s 2% objective to be a reason for officials to alter their own view. We believe that the actual prints have to overshoot their forecasts decently in order for speculation over policy tightening to resurface. If both CPI rates stay around 2%, the pound is unlikely to react much.\n\n\n\nUK CPIs inflation\n\nA few hours later, we have Eurozone\u2019s for May, while during the US session, the US PPIs for June are coming out. Eurozone\u2019s industrial production is expected to have weakened 0.1% mom after improving 0.8% in April, while both the and US PPI rates are expected to have risen further.\n\nOn Thursday, during the Asian session, the main items on the agenda may be Australia\u2019s for June, as well as China\u2019s for Q2, which will be accompanied by the , , and , all for June. In Australia, the is forecast to have ticked down to 5.0% from 5.1%, but the net change in employment is expected to show that the economy has gained less jobs than in May. Specifically, it is expected to show a 30.0k jobs gain following 115.2k new jobs in May.\n\n\n\nAustralia unemployment rate\n\nAt last week\u2019s gathering, the RBA announced that it will proceed with more bond purchases, beyond September, adding that they will reevaluate things in November. With the RBA still wearing its dovish dress, we don\u2019t believe that the anticipated slide in the unemployment rate will be enough to spark speculation that Australian policymakers will turn in the direction of the more hawkish Fed, RBNZ and BoC in the months to come, especially with the employment growth slowing down. Having that in mind, whatever the direction of the broader market sentiment is, we believe that the will underperform the other risk-linked currencies, the likes of Kiwi and Loonie, in the foreseeable future. In other words, we would expect and to drift south for a while more.\n\nAs for the Chinese data, the GDP is expected to have accelerated to +1.3% qoq from +0.6%, while fixed asset investment is anticipated to have slowed to +12.5% yoy from 15.4%. Industrial production and retail sales are expected to have slowed as well, to +7.9% yoy and +11.0% yoy from +8.8% and +12.4% respectively. In our view, despite expectations of some slowdown during the last month of the quarter, it seems that the world\u2019s second largest economy has performed very well during the whole period and thus, we don\u2019t expect this data series to have a major impact on investors\u2019 morale.\n\nLater in the day, we have the UK for May and the US for June. The UK unemployment rate is expected to have held steady at 4.7%, with the employment change slowing to 90k from 113k in April. That said, average weekly earnings, both and , are expected to have accelerated notably in yoy terms, something that could raise concerns over UK inflation eventually overshooting the BoE\u2019s target of 2%, which could in turn tempt central bank officials to start thinking whether it would be better to start normalizing policy sooner than previously anticipated.\n\nFinally, on Friday, the central bank torch will be passed to the BoJ. Its latest meeting resulted in no fireworks, with officials maintaining their policy unchanged and extending the deadline for pandemic-related programs by six months, as was mainly expected to happen at that gathering, or the one scheduled for this week. With both Japan\u2019s headline and core inflation rates around the zero mark, we don\u2019t expect this Bank to adopt a similar stance to other major central banks and start sending signals with regards to whether and when it could start normalizing its policy. We expect policymakers to keep their foot on the extra-loose pedal and perhaps signal that they are willing to leave it there for long. Although, under normal circumstances, a dovish language may have been proven negative for the , we don\u2019t expect the yen to suffer much this week, especially if FX traders start pricing an earlier tightening move by the Fed. Worries over the Delta coronavirus variant could also keep this safe-haven currency supported.\n\n\n\nJapan core CPIs inflation\n\nNew Zealand CPI vs 2yr inflation expectations\n\nAs for Friday\u2019s economic indicators, Asian time, New Zealand\u2019s s for Q2 are coming out, but bearing in mind that they will be released a couple of days after the RBNZ\u2019s monetary policy decision, we don\u2019t believe that they will attract the appropriate attention. Conditional upon the RBNZ appearing optimistic on Wednesday, it would need a notable disappointment in the CPIs for rate-hike expectations to fade. Eurozone\u2019s final s for June are also released, but, as it is always the case, they are expected to confirm their preliminary estimates. Later in the day, we have the US for June, which are expected to have declined again, but at a slower pace than in May, as well as the preliminary index for July, which is forecast to have risen to 86.5 from 85.5."}, {"headline": "Aussie volatile on Delta outbreak", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Best Exchange Rates", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/bestexchangerates.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/virus-1280.jpg?fit=1000%2C500&ssl=1", "author": [], "body": "The growth outlook for the Australian economic became pessimistic when more lockdowns were announced due to rising COVID-19 cases in Sydney.\n\nJobs Report \u2013 US dollar Buy Rumour Sell Fact US Non-Farm Payrolls report was a mixed result \u2013 the Unemployment Rate moved higher but Wages slipped.\n\nFed inflation divisions pulls back US dollar Fed Officials mixed opinions following last week\u2019s hawkish bent reduces markets perception of sooner rate rises.\n\nUS Fed growth forecasts upsets currency markets Last week the US Federal Reserve moved its growth forecasts higher and brought forward the timing of its interest rate hikes to 2023.\n\nPlease note that the opinions of our authors are their own and do not reflect the opinion of Best Exchange Rates and should not be taken as a reference to buy or sell any financial product."}, {"headline": "Markets Week Ahead: USD/JPY, Euro, Dow, Oil, BoC, RBNZ, Inflation, Earnings", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "DailyFX", "date": "4 days ago", "image": "https://a.c-dn.net/b/3uzhYD/headline_GettyImages-1129011763.jpg", "author": ["Rich Dvorak"], "body": "Advertisement\n\nMarkets experienced some turbulence last week as freefalling bond yields concerned investors and fueled an unwind of the reflation trade.

Fear surrounding the delta covid variant \u2013 and its potential to weigh negatively on global growth prospects \u2013 stood out as one key driver of the move.

The Bank of Canada (BoC), the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) and Norges remain on the \"hawkish\" frontlines while the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has started to soften up. The CAD and the NZD are among the cheapest currencies in the G10 and there is merit in pursuing upside in the coming weeks.\n\nCAD and NZ domestic backdrops add more fuel to the fire\n\n\u201cThe BOC, RBNZ and Norges provide the clearest contrast from the rest of its peers, though the broader G10 seems to be showing signs of FOMO. Most recently, the RBA has softened its dovish tone in spite of more restrictive lockdown measures amidst a COVID-19 outbreak and slow vaccinations.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile the RBA does not appear to be in a rush to normalize the cash rate and has retained the April 2024 YCC target bond, the statement no longer maintains \u20182024 at the earliest\u2019. Moreover, the Governor seems to have downplayed the impact of slow vaccinations on the medium-term outlook and the RBA has slowed its asset purchases. All in all, we do not think this is particularly strong enough to entice a major revival in AUD longs. Nonetheless, we think it should, at a minimum, reinforce the 2021 lows and the 200-DMA near 0.76 as key technical support and thresholds for AUD/USD. The MACD does point to a turnaround in price action/sentiment in AUD/USD.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Q2 NZIER Business Survey points to a fairly strong turnaround in the coming six months with hiring intentions and investment shifting meaningfully higher. This has compelled speculation that the RBNZ might hike as soon as this year.

What's more, last week's April industry level GDP report was far less negative than expected, which implies very little revision to the Bank's forecast as Q2 GDP is tracking in the low 3% compared to the BoC's 3.5% from the April MPR.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe NZD and the CAD are among the cheapest in the G10 at nearly 3%. While we see some merit in pursuing this against the USD, we certainly find comfort against the traditional 'funders' and even against the AUD. 1.25 looks to be the local top in USD/CAD for now, and we think fading rallies into next week's BoC meeting is appropriate.\u201d"}, {"headline": "DeFi vs CeFi: Where should you be earning yield?", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Finder", "date": "1 week ago", "image": "https://dvh1deh6tagwk.cloudfront.net/finder-au/wp-uploads/2021/07/defivscefi_finder_1800x1000.png", "author": ["Https", "Www.Finder.Com.Au Author Jamesedwards", "James Edwards", "Secure.Gravatar.Com Avatar", "Posted", "July Pm"], "body": "CeFi now offers highly competitive rates for cryptocurrency and fiat - how can you take advantage?\n\nEarning interest on assets you already own is perhaps the easiest way to grow your portfolio.\n\nThe risk is considerably lower than trading, and doesn't require fresh capital. Plus it puts lazy money to work.\n\nBut where is the best place to earn interest for cryptocurrency users?\n\nMost people think of DeFi as the only way of earning interest (ie, yield) on crypto assets. But there's a much easier and lower-risk alternative for earning interest: Centralized Finance (CeFi).\n\nBest of all? The rates can be just as good, if not better.\n\nCeFi vs DeFi lending rates\n\nTake a look at this table from DeFi Rate which tracks lending rates for leading CeFi platforms.\n\nThen compare that to the rates for three of the biggest DeFi protocols.\n\nThe CeFi lenders (BlockFi, Nexo and Celsius) all currently offer higher rates than their DeFi counterparts (Compound, AAVE and Yearn). They also offer the highest rates for many assets, which we've highlighted in green boxes.\n\nWhy the higher numbers? CeFi lenders use more traditional business models which allow them to offer more stable rates. They lend your funds out to individual borrowers and institutions with fixed repayment rates. That makes for a more predictable rate.\n\nConversely, DeFi protocols mainly use variable rates that are dictated by algorithms, which respond to changes in the market every few minutes.\n\nDeFi protocols also suffer from popularity\n\nWhen a protocol becomes popular, more lenders flock to it in order to earn yield. If the number of borrowers doesn't increase proportionally, then the interest rates for lenders go down.\n\nAs a centralised business, CeFi lenders can avoid this. They can prop up rates by sacrificing their own capital, or cap deposit amounts for individual lenders.\n\nFor instance, Celsius currently guarantees \"6.20% on 1st BTC, 3.51% after\".\n\nSo you don't just get potentially higher rates, but they are more stable, allowing you to forecast your returns and plan accordingly.\n\nCeFi isn't just eating up DeFi. Banks are also in the crosshairs. Just take a look at the rates offered on fiat deposits from Nexo.\n\nA 10% rate absolutely smashes anything conventional banks are offering these days. And unlike DeFi which is restricted to digital assets, CeFi providers accept your old-fashioned dollars, pounds and euros. Celsius is also offering 8.88% on AUD, CAD and HKD stablecoins.\n\nInsurance and risk\n\nAnother upside to using CeFi is insurance.\n\nAs a traditional business, CeFi platforms have more access to insurance options than their DeFi counterparts. Insurance policies vary between providers, ranging from comprehensive to \"nothing to see here\". Here are some example approaches from industry leaders:\n\nNexo: Digital assets are insured through a combination of specialist policies, up to a total of $375 million. Nexo plans to increase this amount to $1 billion by the end of 2021.\n\nDigital assets are insured through a combination of specialist policies, up to a total of $375 million. Nexo plans to increase this amount to $1 billion by the end of 2021. Celsius: Celsius doesn't guarantee insurance itself, but user assets are custodied with FireBlocks and PrimeTrust who have their own insurance policies. Details of those policies haven't been disclosed, however.\n\nBlockFi: BlockFi doesn't publicly disclose any sort of insurance policy.\n\nAnother key benefit of using CeFi is avoiding fees. You only need to transfer your assets once. DeFi protocols can require multiple transactions which can easily eat away at your profits.\n\nSo we've gone through the benefits, but what about the risks?\n\nSmart contract risk: CeFi lenders still utilise smart contracts which makes them vulnerable to many of the same risks as DeFi protocols. Some even use DeFi protocols to generate a portion of returns.\n\nCeFi lenders still utilise smart contracts which makes them vulnerable to many of the same risks as DeFi protocols. Some even use DeFi protocols to generate a portion of returns. Deposit limits: There is typically a deposit limit for high-interest rate products, with the rates decreasing once the limit is crossed.\n\nCentralisation: By using a CeFi platform you are trusting your cryptocurrency with a third party, rather than a smart contract which allows you to retain control over your private keys.\n\nEven with the risks in mind, CeFi offers a seriously attractive alternative to DeFi.\n\nRates are stable and competitive, risk is reduced, and the process is straightforward. There's no need to learn how to use dapps, or chase yield across multiple protocols.\n\nAn increasing number of exchanges such as Binance, Crypto.com and KuCoin now offer lending products, which makes it even easier to keep your finances in one place.\n\nCompare cryptocurrency lenders and start putting your money to work\n\nInterested in cryptocurrency?

With most US investors enjoying 4th of July holiday celebrations price action was muted as liquidity and volume were thin. The AUD bounced between 0.7510 and 0.7540 for much of the day unable to extend upward momentum and recoup losses suffered mid-June. Despite improving risk appetite and elevated commodity prices Investors appear reluctant in extending risk appetite gains. Uncertainty surrounding the Delta variant and global economic recovery have overcome the long run reflation narrative and continue to weigh on the AUD through the near-term. Our attentions today turn to the RBA policy update. Today\u2019s meeting has been billed as a tipping point, wherein policy makers will announce an amendment to the current stance on QE and monetary policy. Market consensus suggest the board will begin tapering bond purchase while maintaining the April 2024 yield curve target. A surprise announcement could spark price action and an interesting market response. A dovish narrative could sink the AUD and see the currency test lows below 0.7450.\n\nKey Movers\n\nFourth of July celebrations meant liquidity across major currencies remained thin through trade on Monday, prompting little price action and narrow ranges. The Euro, GBP, CAD and JPY all tracked sideways reluctant to extend moves outside a 0.2% plus/minus. The Euro did test a break back toward 1.19, touching intraday day highs at 1.1880 after service PMI data surpassed expectations. However, a dip in investor confidence saw the combined unit slip back toward 1.1850 before edging slightly higher into this morning\u2019s open. Our attentions turn now to the US ISM service PMI index. Having touched near record highs in May there is an expectation the index will correct lower in June, however as the US economic recovery gather pace a surprise to the upside is not out of the question. We are keenly attuned to the underlying indicators held within the dataset, particularly input costs. With inflation pressures growing a sustained uptick in through costs driven by supply constraints will likely mean transitory price pressures will remain in play through the near term.\n\nExpected

Tonight, the central bank torch will be passed to the , but we don\u2019t expect any fireworks.\n\nUS Dollar Slides, But Equities Fail To Gain Much On Powell's Cautious Remarks\n\nThe pulled back against most of its major peers on Wednesday and during the Asian session Thursday. It gained only versus and in that order, while it lost the most ground against , , and .\n\n\n\nUSD performance major currencies\n\nThe weakening of the US dollar suggests that market sentiment may have improved at some point yesterday or today in Asia. However, the strengthening of the safe-havens yen and franc points otherwise. Thus, in order to get a clearer picture with regards to the broader market sentiment, we prefer to turn our gaze to the equity world. There, major EU indices traded unchanged or lower, with concerns over high inflation around the globe intensifying after the UK s followed the footprints of the US and accelerated by more than anticipated. The only exceptions were the and Italy\u2019s , which gained somewhat.\n\nIn the US, the and the traded slightly higher, with the latter hitting a fresh record high. However, ended its trading lower. Market sentiment was somewhat more improved during the Asian session today. Although Japan\u2019s fell 0.98%, China\u2019s , Hong Kong\u2019s , and South Korea\u2019s traded in the green.\n\n\n\nMajor global stock indices performance\n\nFed funds futures market expectations on US interest rates\n\nAUD/JPY Technical Outlook\n\nYesterday, when testifying before Congress\u2019s House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, Fed Chief Powell said the US economy is \"still a ways off\" from levels the Committee wants to see before they start normalizing monetary policy. He also added that he still believes the recent rally in inflation is due to the nation\u2019s post-pandemic reopening that that it will prove to be temporary. That said, with data the day before showing that underlying inflation pressures hit their highest since November 1991, many participants may have found it difficult to rely on his remarks. That\u2019s why equities did not rebound confidently, and although the US dollar pulled back, the yen and the franc remained supported. This was also evident by the fact that market participants did not alter much their bets over when they expect the Fed to hit the hike button. Ahead of Powell\u2019s testimony, they were anticipating such a move to take place in January 2023. In the aftermath, that timing was moved just a month back. In other words, expectations are now for the first Fed hike to happen in February 2023.As for our view, we are reluctant to rely on Powell as well. Many Fed members have already expressed their desire for raising interest rates as soon as next year, while, most importantly, underlying inflation, which excludes volatile items such as energy and food, has more than doubled the Fed\u2019s objective of 2%. So, how much of this is transitory? We believe that the US dollar could rebound again soon, but we don\u2019t expect equities to fall. We may see some pullbacks, but we stick to our guns that, now, equity investors are likely to stay more focused on second-quarter earnings, with expectations pointing to decent results. Today, Powell will deliver the same testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, but we don\u2019t expect any surprises. He is very likely to stick to the view that it\u2019s too early to start normalizing policy, and that\u2019s why we don\u2019t believe that we will see strong market moves today.\n\ndrifter lower yesterday and today in Asia, falling below the 82.08 level, which provided support on Monday and Tuesday. Overall, the pair remains below the downside resistance line taken from the high of May 10, which combined with the dip below 82.08, suggests that further declines may be looming in the short run.\n\nIn our view, the dip below 82.08 may have opened the path toward the lows of July 8 and 9, at around 81.32, where another break would confirm a forthcoming lower low on the daily chart and perhaps allow the slide to extend towards the low of February 12, at 81.07. If the bears are not willing to stop there, then a break lower may see scope for extensions towards the 80.67 zone, which supported the price action on February 9 and 11.\n\nNow, in order to start examining a decent correction to the upside, we would like to see a break above 82.80. Such a move would confirm a forthcoming higher high on the 4-hour chart and may initially pave the way towards the high of July 7, at 83.45, or the inside swing low of July 5, at 83.41. Another break, above 83.41, could extend the recovery towards the aforementioned downside line drawn from the high of May 10, or towards the 84.20 territory, defined as a resistance by the high of July 6.\n\n\n\nAUD/JPY 4-hour chart technical analysis\n\nBank Of Canada Tapers Further, But Timing Of Output and Gap Closing Stays Unchanged\n\nApart from Powell\u2019s testimony, yesterday, we also had a BoC monetary policy decision. Canadian policymakers kept their interest rates unchanged and reduced further their QE purchases pace, to CAD 2bn per week from CAD 3bn, as was broadly expected. However, still, the Canadian dollar fell after the decision, to be found as the main loser among the major currencies this morning. In our view, given that the tapering was largely anticipated, Loonie traders focused on other parts in the statement, and specifically on the part saying that officials continue to see the output gap closing in H2 2022. What\u2019s more, at the following the decision, BoC Governor Tiff Macklem said that the outlook is \u201cnot really that different\u201d from April. It seems that CAD-traders may have been looking for something more hawkish, perhaps something to suggest that interest rates are likely to be lifted earlier than previously thought. However, saying that the output gap is still expected to close at the same time as was forecast in April, means that the estimated timing for a rate hike has not changed.\n\n\n\nBank of Canada interest rates\n\nUSD/CAD Technical Outlook\n\nIn our view, yesterday\u2019s decision changes the narrative around the Loonie. Following a very hawkish , we believe that the Canadian currency may now well underperform the Kiwi, even if it performs somewhat better against the Aussie, due to the dovish RBA. We believe that the Loonie could continue underperforming even against the US dollar as, from what we saw yesterday, investors may have remained unconvinced that the Fed will be patient in deciding to start scaling back monetary policy support. Many of them could still be expecting a QE tapering process to start in the next few months. So, long story short, we do believe that will strengthen in the foreseeable future, but we also see decent chances for USD/CAD to continue drifting north for a while more as well.\n\nUSD/CAD triggered some buy orders near the 1.2425 level yesterday following the BoC decision, with the rate returning back above the 1.2490 zone. Overall, the price structure continues to suggest a short-term uptrend above the upside support line drawn from the low of June 10, and thus, we would consider the near-term outlook of this exchange rate to still be positive.\n\nWe believe that the bulls are likely to stay in the driver\u2019s seat for a while more, and perhaps push the action towards the high of July 8, at 1.2590. If they are willing to overcome that hurdle, then their move will confirm a forthcoming higher high on the daily chart and perhaps open the way towards the 1.2627 hurdle, which prevented the bulls from sailing further north several times between Mar. 25 and Apr. 21. If the buyers manage to win the battle near that zone this time around, then we may experience extensions towards the peak of Mar. 8, at around 1.2700.\n\nOn the downside, the move that could signal a short-term bearish reversal may be a dip below yesterday\u2019s low of 1.2425. This may also take the rate below the aforementioned upside line and could initially target the inside swing high of July 5, at around 1.2370. A break below that barrier could see scope for larger bearish extensions, perhaps towards the low of the day after, at 1.2300, or the low of June 23, at 1.2252.\n\n\n\nUSD/CAD 4-hour chart technical analysis\n\nAs For Today's Events\n\nDuring the Asian session, we already got Australia\u2019s report for June, as well as China\u2019s for Q2, which was accompanied by the , , and , all for June. Australia\u2019s fell by more than expected, but the net change in employment showed that the economy added less jobs than anticipated. In our view, this is unlikely to tempt the RBA to take off its dovish dress.\n\nAs for the Chinese data, although the Chinese economy slowed by more than expected in yoy terms, the qoq rate was higher than its own forecast, while IP, FAI and retail sales, all slowed by less than expected, adding to the view that the world\u2019s second largest economy has performed very well during the period. This may have been the catalyst behind the increased risk appetite during the Asian trading today.\n\nTonight, during the Asian session Friday, the central bank torch will be passed to the BoJ. Its latest meeting resulted in no fireworks, with officials maintaining their policy unchanged and extending the deadline for pandemic-related programs by six months, as was mainly expected to happen at that gathering, or the one scheduled for this week. With both Japan\u2019s headline and core inflation rates around the zero mark, we don\u2019t expect this Bank to adopt a similar stance to other major central banks and start sending signals with regards to whether and when it could start normalizing its policy. We expect policymakers to keep their foot on the extra-loose pedal and perhaps signal that they are willing to leave it there for long. Although, under normal circumstances, a dovish language may have been proven negative for the Japanese yen, we don\u2019t expect the yen to suffer much after the decision, especially if FX traders start repricing an earlier tightening move by the Fed. Worries over the Delta coronavirus variant could also keep this safe-haven currency supported.\n\n\n\nJapanese core CPIs yoy inflation\n\nAs for the speakers, besides Fed Chair Powell, who will repeat his testimony, we will also get to hear from Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, ECB Executive Board member Frank Elderson and BoE MPC member Michael Saunders."}, {"headline": "Australia stocks lower at close of trade; S&P/ASX 200 down 0.26% By Investing.com", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "Up News Info -", "date": "9 hours ago", "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXNPEC9302N_L.jpg", "author": [], "body": "\n\n\u00a9 Reuters.

Downside exposure in USD/JPY, AUD/JPY and GBP/JPY is on the rise. IGCS can at times be a contrarian indicator. Meaning that, if this trend in positioning continues, the Yen could be vulnerable ahead. To learn more, check out last week\u2019s recording on my IGCS webinar.\n\nUSD/JPY Sentiment Outlook - Bullish\n\nThe IGCS gauge implies that roughly 50% of retail traders are net-long USD/JPY. Upside exposure has decreased by 6.36% and 2.77% over a daily and weekly basis respectively. With that in mind, the combination of current sentiment and recent changes offers a stronger bullish contrarian trading bias.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nUSD/JPY is resting former rising support from the beginning of this year. The pair has been struggling to find follow-through to the downside as the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) maintained the dominant upside focus. The former trendline could come into play as new resistance, sending prices back lower. Immediate support seems to be at 109.53.\n\nUSD/JPY Daily Chart\n\nChart Created in Trading View\n\nAUD/JPY Sentiment Outlook - Bullish\n\nThe IGCS gauge implies that about 40% of retail traders are net-long AUD/JPY. Downside exposure increased by 4.72% and 13.68% over a daily and weekly basis respectively. The fact traders are net-short hints prices may prices. The combination of that and recent changes in sentiment further compounds a bullish contrarian trading bias.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nAUD/JPY continues to consolidate just above the key 81.323 \u2013 81.987 support zone, attempting to extend losses since May\u2019s top. A bearish crossover between the 20- and 50-day SMAs hints at a near-term downward technical bias. However, the 200-day SMA is nearing and it could reinstate the dominant upward trajectory as key support.\n\nAUD/JPY Daily Chart\n\nChart Created in Trading View\n\nGBP/JPY Sentiment Outlook - Bullish\n\nThe IGCS gauge implies that about 36% of retail investors are net-long GBP/JPY. Downside exposure increased by 3.56% and 6.08% over a daily and weekly basis respectively. The fact traders are net-short suggests prices may continue to rise. In addition to this, recent shifts in sentiment is offering a stronger bullish contrarian trading bias.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nGBP/JPY could be vulnerable to extending May\u2019s top after a bearish crossover formed between the 20-day and 50-day SMAs. Sustaining losses entails clearing the 150.67 \u2013 151.32 support zone. That would expose the 148.53 \u2013 149.38 range. Rising support from 2020 could also come into play, reinstating the dominant upside focus.\n\nGBP/JPY Daily Chart\n\nChart Created in Trading View\n\n*IG Client Sentiment Charts and Positioning Data Used from July 13th Report\n\n--- Written by Daniel Dubrovsky, Strategist for DailyFX.com\n\nTo contact Daniel, use the comments section below or @ddubrovskyFX on Twitter"}, {"headline": "AUDJPY Up 1 Pips in Last Hour, Moves Down For the 2nd Consecutive Day; Doji and Pin Bar Patterns Appearing on Chart", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "CFDTrading", "date": "1 day ago", "image": "https://www.cfdtrading.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/cfdtrading-l2.png", "author": [], "body": "Hourly Update\n\n(Last Updated July 15, 2021 17:12 GMT)\n\nAt the moment, AUDJPY\u2019s rate is up 90 pips (0.01%) from the hour prior. The hourly chart shows that AUDJPY has seen 2 straight up hours. Regarding the trend, note that the strongest trend exists on the 100 hour timeframe. Price action traders may also wish to note that we see a pin bar candlestick pattern on AUDJPY. Given that we see downtrend on the 20 and 10 hourly candle timeframe, and that such candlestick patterns often denote reversals, this may be worth noting. The moving averages on the hourly timeframe suggest a choppiness in price, as the are all in a mixed alignment \u2014 meaning the trend across timeframes is inconsistent, indicating a potential opportunity for rangebound traders.\n\nAUDJPY End of Day Recap\n\nUpdated 00:30 GMT (04:30 EST)\n\nAUDJPY is down 2 pips (0.03%) since the previous day (opening today near 82.281), marking the 2nd consecutive day a decline has happened. Compared to its peers in the Forex, AUDJPY gave its buyers a return that ranked 20th in terms of percentage change since the previous day. The price chart of AUDJPY below illustrates.\n\nAUDJPY Technical Analysis\n\nComing into today AUDJPY is now close to its 20, 50, 100 and 200 day averages, located at 83.1315, 84.0857, 83.976 and 81.0376 respectively, and thus may be at a key juncture along those timeframes. As for the alignment of the moving averages, well, it\u2019s a bit mixed up; the 20, 50, 100, and 200 do not progress from largest to smallest, or vice versa. The closest is the 20 day average, which is 85 pips away. Trend traders will want to observe that the strongest trend appears on the 30 day horizon; over that time period, price has been moving down. Or to simplify this another way, note that out of the past 30 days AUDJPY\u2019s price has gone down 16 them. Oh, and one last thing: if you trade off of candlesticks, note that we\u2019re seeing doji and pin bar patterns appearing here."}, {"headline": "AUD/JPY changes back to a bearish undertone for a test of 200-DMA at 81.00 \u2013 DBS Bank", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "FXStreet", "date": "2 days ago", "image": "https://editorial.fxstreet.com/images/Markets/Currencies/Crosses/AUDJPY/forex-australia-and-japanese-currency-pair-with-calculator-4780678_Large.jpg", "author": [], "body": "\u201cSince fetching a 85.80 high, AUD/JPY is exhibiting receding momentum.

At current levels, there is staggered resistance posted up at the 84.26-84.80 stretch. Resistance is kicking in at the Tenkan-Kijun price levels of 82.75 and 83.18, respectively.\u201d\n\nAUD/JPY\u2019s 43.3% rally from March 2020\u2019s 59.90 appears to have lost its sparkle, and likely to have paused or ended at 85.80. A bearish candlestick pattern on the monthly chart , and prices treading under the daily Ichimoku cloud are signs of a subtle yet slow shift to a bearish undertone. An accelerating sustained decline under 80.92 would be affirmative of this, according to Benjamin Wong, Strategist at DBS Bank.\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Dollar is the second weakest, next to Yen.\n\nTechnically, developments in both EUR/JPY and GBP/JPY suggest that stronger rally is underway.

The decline in conditions was broad-based across states but led by a significant decline in Victoria coming off the back of the lockdown that started in late May but was eased, in a series of steps, over June\u201d said NAB.\n\n\u201cConfidence took a hit in the month with the survey undertaken in the week of the NSW lockdown and with some overlap to brief shutdowns in the smaller capitals.

Intraday bias is back on the upside for retesting 155.13/156.05 resistance zone next. On the downside, though, break of 152.38 minor support will dampen the bullish case and turn bias neutral first. In this case, correction from 156.05 might still extend with another falling leg.\n\nIn the bigger picture, rise from 123.94 is seen as the third leg of the pattern from 122.75 (2016 low). Focus remains on 156.59 resistance (2018 high). Sustained break there should confirm long term bullish trend reversal. Next target is 61.8% retracement of 195.86 (2015 high) to 122.75 at 167.93. On the downside, break of 149.03 support is needed to be the first sign of completion of the rise from 123.94. Otherwise, outlook will remain bullish even in case of deep pull back.\n\nEconomic Indicators Update"}]}, {"id": "AUD/NZD", "price_data": [1.0829700231552124, 1.0815000534057617, 1.080989956855774,

ones to take note of today as highlighted in bold.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn particular, the big one for AUD/USD stands out at 0.7500, which offers a sort of topside for the pair considering the dollar's resilience and recent negative developments with regards to the Australian virus situation.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith regards to the latter, just be wary that the aussie may be open to move further out of its recent range (this week between 0.7430 and 0.7500) once the expiries roll off and as we look towards the week ahead.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the context of the recent backdrop, the kiwi is looking more bullish considering the economic and policy divergence between Australia and NZ. As such, a further drag on AUD/NZD could create further pressures on the aussie moving forward.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs for the other expiries today, there are big ones in between the current spot price for EUR/USD which is likely to keep price action more anchored once again.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, USD/JPY is holding below a couple of large ones at 110.00-10 though sentiment in Treasury yields is still arguably the key driver for the pair at the moment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information on how to use this data, you may refer to this post here\n\n\n\n"}, {"headline": "Look To Sell Australian Dollar And Buy The New Zealand Dollar Say MUFG", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Exchange Rates UK", "date": "10 hours ago", "image": "https://images.exchangerates.org.uk/uploads/new-zealand-dollar-1-m.jpg", "author": [], "body": "Following the latest policy meeting, MUFG agrees with the market consensus that a rate hike will be brought forward with a rate hike realistic in August or October.\n\nThere is scope for further New Zealand dollar gains, but buying against the Australian dollar could be more attractive than selling the US dollar.\n\nThe New Zealand dollar to US Dollar (NZD/USD) exchange rate traded just above 0.7000 while the Australian Dollar to New Zealand Dollar (AUD/NZD) held substantial losses to 1.0625 from 1.0720 ahead of the RBNZ meeting.\n\nThe Pound to New Zealand dollar (GBP/NZD) exchange rate pared losses to trade at 1.9765 from lows just below 1.9700.\n\nAugust Rate Hike Possible after Hawkish RBNZ Tone\n\nMUFG notes that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) usually signals its policy intensions very clearly and this meeting was no exception.\n\nThe bank announced that asset purchases will be suspended from July 23rd and also dropped references to considerable time and patience being needed to achieve its objectives.\n\nNew Zealand bond yields have increased following the data with markets now expecting a rate increase in August.\n\nThe bank notes; \u201cThe scale of the shift today certainly provides scope for the RBNZ to move before November. 18th August and 6th October are now both live meetings.\u201d\n\nMUFG expects that higher short-term yields will support the New Zealand currency.\n\n\u201cThe jump in the short-term spread will provide further support for NZD/USD.

Regarding the labour market, Mr Powell felt that when holidays finished, schools reopened, and federal unemployment benefits rolled off, labour market pressures would alleviate. In other words, the Federal Reserve remains with its tent firmly pitched in the transitory inflation camp, and that the FOMC were still far away from meeting the conditions to begin tapering monetary stimulus.\n\nBond yields, which had only grudgingly moved higher post the US inflation data, quickly retraced those rises overnight, precious metals rose, and the US Dollar retraced some of its previous days' gains. The biggest sigh of relief was probably heard around Asia, where the threat of a divergence in the direction of monetary policy would have weighed heavily.\n\nUS stock markets had a mixed day, giving back intraday gains, with the main indexes finishing each side off unchanged. The no news is good news from Mr Powell, perhaps offset by the Fed Beige Book, which showed many businesses expected to see rising input and selling prices in the months ahead. Additionally, after a decent run higher, the US earnings season may well have elements of buying the rumour, selling the fact with lots of good news priced into upcoming results. Still, equities remain near record highs, so despite the sideways shuffle last night, it really is business as usual.\n\nThe US releases another plethora of data this evening, including Industrial Production, Initial Jobless Claims, the NY Empire State Manufacturing Index and Import and Export Prices. The impact on markets will be minimal now that Mr Powell has held fast on the transitory mantra and steadied the ship. As I stated earlier in the week, respect the momentum, and follow the momentum until it changes as many intelligent people worldwide are as divided as a US Congress on whether we are sticky or transitory.\n\nThe data calendar has been busy today in Asia. South Korea held rates unchanged this morning at 0.50%, although the decision was not unanimous. The Bank of Japan will meet tomorrow amid speculation in Tokyo that they will downgrade the GDP outlook for 2021. I am expecting no change in policy, however.\n\nChina released a solid, if unspectacular by their standards set of data this morning. Retail Sales rose by 12.1% YoY for June, slightly better than expected. In June, Fixed Asset Investment (YTD) rose 12.40%, less than May but better than forecast. Industrial Production rose by 8.30%, while GDP YoY for Q2 rose 7.90%, and QoQ by 1.30%. The data mostly showed an easing from the high baseline effects but was modestly above expectations.\n\nOn releasing the data, China's National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) noted still faces external uncertainties and an unbalanced recovery between the export-facing and domestic sides of the economy. After setting a slightly weaker USD/CNY fix today (in Yuan terms), the PBOC also rolled over a maturing 100 billion Yuan one-year MLF facility today, injecting funding at the one-year Loan Prime Rate. That is very much a similar mantra of many a central bank at the moment. Coming after the RRR cut last Friday, it seems the monetary policy is quietly moving to the side of caution in China, especially with the World Bank downgrading Asian GDP, ex-China, overnight.\n\nAustralia may be in various stages of lockdown, but it continues to push out data that supports its \"lucky country\" nickname. Employment data was impressive, with a fall in part-time jobs by 22,500 handsomely offset by a rise in full-time employment by 51,600, while the unemployment rate eased to 4.90%. That won't budge the RBA from its dovish perch, which wants to see even lower unemployment pushing up wages before it moves. It does, however, show that Australia's economy continues to power through the rolling lockdowns. The currency didn't react, though, as local markets are cautious about the whack-a-mole spread of the delta-variant to Melbourne, South Australia and the extension of the Sydney lockdown.\n\nIndia dodged a stagflationary bullet last night, as WPI Inflation stays elevated about the RBI target but eased slightly from the month before. That has taken some temporary pressure on the Indian Rupee for now. Sentiment in Asia, ex-China, remains fragile, though. Covid-19 is the reason, and here in Indonesia and Malaysia, the situation is dire indeed. But the rest of the region is also playing a catchup game, and this will continue to mute sentiment, with the World Bank growth downgrade likely to be the first of many.\n\nStock markets are mixed in Asia\n\nStock markets are a mixed bag in Asia after Wall Street limped to an almost unchanged finish despite the Powell testimony steadying the ship. The S&P 500 finished 0.12% higher, the Nasdaq closed 0.22% lower, and the Dow Jones edged 0.13% higher. With little direction from Wall Street, which seems to be focusing on upcoming earnings now, Asian markets have been left to their own individual devices.\n\nThe Nikkei 225 has fallen 0.88% as speculation mounts that the Bank of Japan will downgrade its outlook for the economy at tomorrow's policy meeting. Despite a slightly hawkish bent to the statement, the Bank of Korea kept rates at a record low of 0.50% this morning, which has lifted the Kospi by 0.45%.\n\nIn China, the solid, if unspectacular data dump today see the Shanghai Composite edging 0.20% higher, while the CSI 300 is up just 0.10%. However, Hong Kong has jumped 1.15% as China tech giants talk about opening up their ecosystems to each other, something markets feel will please their ultimate bosses in Beijing. Hong Kong should also benefit from a rotation of China IPOs from the US going forward.\n\nTaipei has risen by 0.45% today, while Singapore has fallen 0.40% after another surge in Covid-19 cases. Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta have, quite surprisingly, climbed by 0.50% in what I assume are technical moves after some previously tricky sessions. I would approach rallies in each with a large grain of salt given the Covid-19 situations both are experiencing. Regional Asia had the most to lose from a change in Fed tone, and the Powell testimony overnight has likely driven the gains. Bangkok is 0.20% higher while Manilla has fallen 0.80%.\n\nThe impressive Australian employment data has not been enough to keep markets in the green there, as new cases of Covid-19 pop up across Australia, raising fears of ever-expanding lockdowns. The ASX 200 is 0.30% lower, while the All Ordinaries has eased by 0.10%.\n\nEuropean stock markets should ignore Asia as a result of their vaccination premium. With the Fed still unconcerned about inflation, that should be enough to lift European stocks initially. It is unlikely that Wall Street will sustain any significant dips into the end of the week either. As I have said before, respect the momentum.\n\nTransitory Fed weakens US Dollar\n\nWith Jerome Powell firmly camped still in the transitory inflation corner, US bond yields unwound their previous day's rise, and that saw the US Dollar give back part of its previous session's gains. The dollar index fell 0.44% to 92.37 overnight, leaving it mid-range between support at 92.00 and resistance at 92.85, which it once again tested and failed at intra-session overnight. Currency markets continue to show more caution on the inflation equation than either stocks or bonds, and this has been the case for the past couple of weeks. In the meantime, a break of the aforementioned support/resistance levels is now required to signal the US Dollar's next directional move.\n\nA dovish Powell lifted EUR/USD off its 1.1770 lows overnight, rallying to 1.1850, where it remains in moribund trade in Asia. With inflation data remaining soggy in Europe, the single currency needs to recapture the 1.1900 regions to signal a greater recovery. Otherwise, a break of 1.1770 could still signal a deeper correction to between 1.1500/1.1600. A Bank of England official suggested that UK rate hikes could be getting closer overnight, which saw Sterling climb 0.35% to 1.3860. That rally has faded in Asia, with GBP/USD falling to 1.3840. GBP/USD has clear support at 1.3800 and resistance at 1.3900.\n\nAUD/USD has fallen 0.30% to 0.7460 in Asia, despite very impressive employment data. Covid-19 worries are clearly perceived as a more immediate threat to AUD/USD today, and resistance at 0.7500 looks safe for now. Large options expiries at that level today, though, mean that AUD/USD is unlikely to track much lower intra-session. AUD/NZD selling may also be weighing on the Australian Dollar after a hawkish RBNZ pushed the NZD/USD higher yesterday. NZD/USD has held gains above 0.7000 overnight, and if inflation data released tomorrow morning is higher than expected, the tightening noise will increase. That should see the Kiwi continue to rally versus the US Dollar and Australian Dollars.\n\nAsian currencies have recorded modest gains overnight in a collective sigh of relief after Jerome Powell kept the Fed in the dovish corner. USD/INR has fallen to 74.476 and USD/KRW to 1141.10, helped along by firm India inflation data and a slightly hawkish Bank of Korea. However, the retracements are shallow, and in the case of USD/IDR, USD/THB and USD/MYR, they are almost non-existent. The latter three remain the most vulnerable to further weakness along with the Philippines as all four continue to grapple with challenging Covid-19 situations. The fall in oil prices overnight will have done the IDR and MYR no favours, and you can throw in political uncertainty into the Ringgit as well. With USD/CNY content to range between 6.4500 and 6.5000, it is regional Asia that remains the most vulnerable to further losses for now.\n\nOPEC+ sends oil lower\n\nReports are emerging that Saudi Arabia and the UAE have reached an agreement on their dispute, with the UAE apparently securing a higher production baseline. That followed official US crude inventory data that showed another large fall in headline inventories but a significant increase in gasoline and distillate stocks.\n\nThat combined to seen oil prices sharply lower, with Brent crude falling by 2.40% to $74.50 a barrel and WTI falling by 3.0% to $72.90 a barrel. The sell-off has continued in Asia, with both contracting falling around 0.50% to $74.20 and $72.50 a barrel, respectively.\n\nANy agreement between Saudi Arabia and the UAE must be signed off by the whole OPEC+ grouping, adding a layer of uncertainty to the proceedings. Further muddying the waters, Iraq has also allegedly now asked for a higher production baseline. If this is the start of a flood of member requests, then oil prices are now vulnerable to a deeper correction lower.\n\nThe threat of weaker OPEC+ cohesion and higher than anticipated production will cap oil price gains for now. Brent crude has support at $74.00 and $72.00 a barrel, and failure of $72.00 could see a speculative capitulation trade occur, although I expect its duration to be short, if brutal. WTI's line in the sand will be at $70.00 a barrel, and I expect some similarly ugly stop-loss selling to occur if it fails.\n\nOil's underlying positive fundamentals remain intact, despite the Covid-19 issues across Asia, ex-China. Oil's short-term price action will revolve around OPEC+ cohesion and whether higher baseline production requests start flowing in from other members.\n\nGold's price action looks impressive\n\nGold prices rallied overnight after Jerome Powell was suitably dovish in his congressional testimony. Gold rose 1.10% to $1827.50 an ounce, closing just above its 200-day moving average (DMA) at $1826.50 an ounce, a bullish technical development.\n\nGold has weathered the storm of higher US yields and a higher US Dollar with aplomb this week, remaining rock solid at $1800.00 an ounce and comfortably above support at its 100-DMA at $1790.00 an ounce. It has resumed its rally powerfully as soon as those pressures alleviated, and this implies to me that gold is targeting further gains ahead.\n\nGold has support at $1820.00 and $1800.00 an ounce, with the bullish outlook intact as long as the 100-DMA at $1791.00 holds on a closing basis. Gold's next upside targets are $1845.00 and $1860.00 an ounce, although I expect more of a slow grind higher, rather than the fast jump seen overnight."}, {"headline": "All Steady On The Policy Front...For Now", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Investing.com", "date": "12 hours ago", "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/redesign/images/seo/investingcom_analysis_og.jpg", "author": [], "body": "Fed Chair on Wednesday maintained both patience and dovish narrative, despite the blockbuster US and reports for June.\n\nUS to slid more than 6bp, reversing the post-CPI/bond supply selloff.

Japan\u2019s markets broke a two-day winning streak which saw the Nikkei initially lose -0.8% before recovering to around -0.26%. China\u2019s CSI300 is trading -0.9% and one of the worst performers, the Hang Seng is off -0.6% although the ASX 200 is 0.1% higher despite Sydney extending its lockdown in Sydney. Futures markets are a touch lower for US and Europe which points to a softer open.\n\nToday\u2019s main event is for Jerome Powell\u2019s testimony in front of congress at 17:00 BST. He could face some tough questioning over such a loose policy, given inflation rose to a 30-year high yesterday. Therefore, any signs of weakness in his responses may be construed as tapering coming sooner (and at a faster pace) than presently suggested, in turn bringing forward expectations for hikes to send the US dollar higher and equities lower. Although, as exciting as that sounds, it\u2019s more likely he\u2019ll stick to his \u2018inflation is transitory\u2019 script.\n\n\n\n\n\nFTSE 350: Market Internals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFTSE 350: 4088.73 (-0.01%) 13 July 2021\n\n81.48% of stocks closed above their 200-day average\n\n58.97% of stocks closed above their 50-day average\n\n19.66% of stocks closed above their 20-day average\n\n\n\n\n\nForex: NZD soars following RBNZ\u2019s less dovish meeting\n\nAs it can be clearly seen on the forex dashboard, it was all about the New Zealand dollar in overnight trade. RBNZ confirmed they will halt their LSAP (Large Scale Asset Purchase Programme) by July 23rd which sent the Kiwi dollar sharply higher across the board. Their outlook on the economy was a net-positive although reiterated their view of transitory inflation (sound familiar?) and that risks form COVID-19 remain.\n\nAlready ANZ bank have revised their call to now see a hike in August, which was recently bought forward to November just two weeks ago. That one is up for debate as RBNZ still maintain inflation to be transitory, and they\u2019re not likely to want to be \u2018first in\u2019 on the hiking path.\n\nNZD/CAD is probing the July high ahead of today\u2019s BOC meeting. As mentioned in the Asian open report, if BOC disappoint with their level of expected tapering then it could help NZD/CAD hold onto early gains from the RBNZ meeting. So far, so good. Of course, the risks here is that BOC do taper which puts a damper on upside potential for this cross.\n\nGBP/NZD was the biggest downside mover overnight falling -1.00% and reaching 150% of its 10-day ATR. Yet the volatility award goes to AUD/NZD which fell around -0.8% but hit around 200% of its 10-day ATR.\n\nGBP/USD is trading around yesterday\u2019s lows after rolling over form 1.3900. It\u2019s holding above 1.3800 and the weekly S1 pivot and trying to hold above the broken trendline outlined in yesterday\u2019s European report. So, we see the potential for a minor bounce from current levels but, if the US dollar index breaks above 92.80 resistance then we should see GBP/USD break below 1.3800. Keep an eye on UK inflation data scheduled for 09:30 BST.\n\n\n\n\n\nGBP and AUD are both lower this week, but perhaps a stronger than expected CPI print can help support GBP/AUD. It\u2019s been trending higher since the January low and recently hit a three-month high before retracing gently lower. It is now trying to build a base above the support zone mentioned on Monday, so we\u2019d consider a bullish engulfing candle or bullish reversal pattern around current levels to be a clue that momentum is about to pop higher once more.\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn how to trade forex\n\n\n\n\n\nCommodities:\n\nCopper futures were slightly lower following the stronger dollar and higher inflation yesterday. But, like most metals at present, they remain between key support and resistance levels and are struggling to breakout during summer trade.\n\nWTI has edged lower from its 5-day high overnight, although we remain bullish above 73.68 (yesterday\u2019s low. Although bullish patterns around or above the weekly pivot at 74.13 could be of interest for bulls.\n\n\n\n\n\nUp Next (Times in BST)\n\nYou can view all the scheduled events for today using our economic calendar, and keep up to date with the latest market news and analysis here.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to trade with City Index\n\nFollow these easy steps to start trading with City Index today:\n\nOpen a City Index account, or log-in if you\u2019re already a customer.

data.\n\nIn recent weeks, new virus outbreaks, a chaotic vaccine rollout and a tightening of already strict curbs on international travel have reignited threats to the country\u2019s economic revival.\n\nIn China, Australia\u2019s largest trading partner, the economy grew slightly more slowly than expected in the second quarter, weighed down by higher raw material costs and new COVID-19 outbreaks, as expectations build that policymakers may have to do more to support the recovery.\n\nAt 11:21 GMT, the AUD/USD is trading .7749, down 0.0035 or -0.46%.\n\nIn other news, better than expected labor market data in Australia garnered little response from traders. Australia\u2019s jobless rate, led by the country\u2019s remarkable recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, improved to a level last seen during the once-in-a-generation mining boom and may help bring forward the date of monetary policy tightening.\n\nThursday\u2019s data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed 29,000 net new jobs were created in June, in-line with forecasts for a 30,000 gain and on top of 115,100 in May. The increase was entirely led by full-time jobs, which jumped by 51,600.\n\nUnemployment dropped to 4.9%, the lowest since December 2010, when a mining investment boom that ended in 2013 was powering Australia\u2019s economy.\n\nDaily AUD/USD\n\nDaily Swing Chart Technical Analysis\n\nThe main trend is down according to the daily swing chart, however, momentum has been trending higher since the formation of the closing price reversal bottom on July 9.\n\nA trade through .7410 will negate the closing price reversal bottom and signal a resumption of the downtrend. The main trend will change to up on a trade through .7599.\n\nThe minor trend is also down. A trade through .7503 will change the minor trend to up. This will confirm the shift in momentum.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe AUD/USD is currently trading inside a major retracement zone at .7499 to .7379. This zone is controlling the longer-term direction of the Forex pair. Inside this range is the minor 50% level or pivot at .7457.\n\nThe short-term range is .7599 to .7410. Its retracement zone at .7505 to .7527 is resistance.\n\nDaily Swing Chart Technical Forecast\n\nThe direction of the AUD/USD on Thursday is likely to be determined by trader reaction to .7457.\n\nBearish Scenario\n\nA sustained move under .7456 will indicate the presence of sellers. If this creates enough downside momentum then look for the selling to possibly extend into .7410. If this fails then look for a test of .7379.\n\nBearish Scenario\n\nA sustained move over .7457 will signal the presence of buyers. This could trigger a surge into a cluster of resistance levels at .7499, .7503, .7505 and .7527. The latter is a potential trigger point for an acceleration into .7593 to .7599.\n\nFor a look at all of today\u2019s economic events, check out our economic calendar.\n\n\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:"}, {"headline": "AUD/USD Price Forecast \u2013 Australian Dollar Continues Downward Consolidation", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "FX Empire", "date": "4 hours ago", "image": "https://responsive.fxempire.com/width/600/webp-lossy-70.q50/_fxempire_/2021/06/AUD-USD-1-1.jpg", "author": [], "body": "The Australian dollar has fallen again during the course of the trading session on Thursday as the Australian dollar continues that very sickly, as the Australians have been locking parts of their economy down yet again.

The Australian state of Victoria was ordered into a five-day lockdown on Thursday following a spike in COVID-19 infections, which, in turn, was seen as a key factor that acted as a headwind for the AUD/USD pair.\n\nApart from this, a slowdown in Chinese economic growth further dented exerted some additional pressure on the China-proxy aussie. In fact, China's annualized GDP growth for the second quarter of 2021 stood at 7.9% as against consensus estimates pointing to 8.1% and 18.3% previous. The combination of factors took its toll on the global risk sentiment and further drove flows away from the perceived riskier Australian dollar.\n\nMeanwhile, the risk-off environment \u2013 as depicted by a generally weaker tone around the equity markets \u2013 underpinned the safe-haven US dollar. The supporting factor, to a larger extent, helped offset the Fed Chair Jerome Powell's dovish testimony on Wednesday, the ongoing decline in the US Treasury bond yields and Thursday's rather unimpressive US macro releases.\n\nData published by the US Department of Labor (DOL) revealed that there were 360K initial claims for unemployment benefits during the week ending July 10. This was lower than the previous week's upwardly revised reading of 386K. Separately, the NY Fed's Empire State Manufacturing improved sharply to 43 in June from 17.4 previous, while the Philly Fed Manufacturing Index fell more than expected to 21.9 from 30.7 in May.\n\nNext on tap will be the second day of Powell's semi-annual congressional testimony. Powell is unlikely to deviate from his view that the recent rise in inflationary pressures was only temporary and would still likely moderate shortly. This should act as a headwind for the greenback and lend some support to the AUD/USD pair. That said, COVID-19 jitters favours bearish traders and supports prospects for further losses.\n\nTechnical levels to watch"}, {"headline": "AUD/USD Bearish Momentum: 0.527% Down In The Last 24 Hours", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "Via News", "date": "5 hours ago", "image": "https://via.news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/wp-apub__negative__-22.jpg", "author": ["Vianews Editorial Team Report.", "Real-Time Financial News", "Analysis.", "Contact Supportatvianewsagency.Com For Inquiries.", "Please Enter Your Name Here"], "body": "(VIANEWS) \u2013 AUD/USD (AUDUSD) is currently on bearish momentum.

Following a 1.3% contraction in May, Retail Sales are expected to decline by 0.4% on a monthly basis.\n\nThe general market view is that a positive surprise in the Retail Sales reading is likely to provide a boost to the greenback and vice versa. In order to understand how impactful this data is on the USD\u2019s performance against its rivals, we analyzed the market reaction of four major pairs, EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY and AUD/USD, to the previous 11 Retail Sales prints.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe FXStreet Economic Calendar assigns a deviation point to each macroeconomic data release to show how big the divergence was between the actual print and the market consensus. Although Retail Sales were unchanged in April, the deviation was -0.37 because analysts were expecting a 1% increase.\n\nOn the flip side, the 7.6% increase recorded in January against analysts\u2019 estimate of 1.1% was a relatively big positive surprise with the deviation posting 5.82 for that particular release.\n\n\u201cDeviation: It measures the surprise caused when the Actual data differs from the Consensus. It can oscillate in an open scale, usually between -7 and +7.\u201d\n\nNext, we plotted the reaction, in terms of pips, of the major pairs mentioned above 15 minutes, one hour and four hours after the release to see if the general market view held.\n\nFinally, we calculated the correlation coefficient (r) to figure out which major pair had the strongest correlation at which time frame. When r approaches -1, it suggests there is a significant inverse correlation, while a significant positive correlation is identified when r moves toward 1.\n\nResults\n\nThere were eight negative surprises and three positive surprises in the previous 11 releases. On average, the deviation was -0.62 on disappointing prints and 2.6 on upbeat figures. 15 minutes after a negative surprise, the average gains in EUR/USD and GBP/USD were 0.38, 3.88 pips, respectively, while USD/JPY and AUD/USD lost 2.63 pips and 0.75 pips, respectively. On the other hand, EUR/USD, USD/JPY and GBP/USD lost 5.6, 1.3 and 0.33 pips respectively, on average following positive surprises while AUD/USD gained 0.33 pips. This finding suggests that the initial market reaction to Retail Sales data is largely muted.\n\n15-min deviation chart\n\n60-min deviation chart\n\n240-min deviation chart\n\nEUR/USD\n\nEUR/USD has a correlation coefficient of -0.49, -0.31 and -0.09 15 minutes, 60 minutes and 240 minutes after the release, respectively. These numbers suggest that the inverse correlation between the Retail Sales deviation and EUR/USD action is virtually non-existent one hour and four hours after the release. Although the initial reaction is somewhat correlated, the average pip-change is too small to consider it as a trading opportunity.\n\nGBP/USD\n\nGBP/USD has a correlation coefficient of -0.53, -0.41 and -0.31 15 minutes, 60 minutes and 240 minutes after the release, respectively. Similar to EUR/USD, the inverse correlation of the GBP/USD pip-change with the Retail Sales deviation weakens gradually and fades away four hours after the release.\n\nUSD/JPY\n\nUSD/JPY has a correlation coefficient of 0.11, -0.51 and -0.69 15 minutes, 60 minutes and 240 minutes after the release, respectively. The pair\u2019s initial reaction to Retail Sales data is largely unpredictable. However, the correlation turns inverse one hour after the release and becomes significant by the fourth hour. This finding suggests that if Retail Sales print is better than expected, USD/JPY falls and vice versa.\n\nAUD/USD\n\nAUD/USD has a correlation coefficient of -0.12, -0.07 and 0.1 15 minutes, 60 minutes and 240 minutes after the release, respectively, making it the least correlated pair, out of the four tested, with US Retail Sales surprises.\n\nSummary\n\nWhen there is a negative or a positive surprise in US Retail Sales data, the initial market reaction is insignificant. There is no clear relationship between the movements of EUR/USD, GBP/USD and AUD/USD pairs and the deviation one hour and four hours after the release. This could be due to the fact that Retail Sales is impacted by temporary factors, such as weather conditions and holiday seasons, making it an unreliable leading indicator.\n\nThe most interesting finding is the strong inverse correlation with USD/JPY and Retail Sales deviation four hours after the release. Nevertheless, the average pip-change on that time frame is 5.3 and -8.3 pips on a negative and positive deviation, respectively, not providing enough room for a trading opportunity."}, {"headline": "Free Forex Signals and Forecast: Buy AUD/USD \u2013 15 July 2021", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "", "date": "7 hours ago", "image": "https://forextv.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/favicon.ico", "author": ["Forex Crunch"], "body": "Our free forex signals service today looks at the AUD/USD pair and we have the entry, stop and take profits levels for you.

"author": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "body": "This press release serves to correct a typo made in the previous release.\n\nLONDON, UK / ACCESSWIRE / July 15, 2021 / Interlay, an interoperability start-up focusing on investing, earning and paying with BTC on any blockchain, today announced its seed capital raise of USD 3.04mm. The seed funding round was led by IOSG Ventures, and co-investors including Blockchain.com, Launchub Ventures, CMS Holdings, KR1, Hypersphere, Zeeprime, and angels (Blockchain.com CEO & ex-Bitmain leadership) as other major participants. This equity financing raise was to accelerate the company's growth to other blockchains beyond Polkadot, to put the company on track of team expansion, and to meet strong demand on developing v2 of the bridge technology powering interBTC.\n\n\"We are extremely pleased to have the support of top investors from various ecosystems and geographic locations, who believe in our mission to bring Bitcoin to all major blockchains such as Polkadot, Ethereum and Cosmos,\" said Alexei Zamyatin, Founder and CEO of Interlay. \"Together, we will accelerate the development and adoption of interBTC, Interlay's flagship product, and allow people to invest, earn and pay with BTC on any blockchain in a truly trustless and decentralized way.\"\n\nAfter a few years of academic research on Bitcoin interoperability, Alexei Zamyatin and Dominik Harz, the first two PhDs of Imperial College's cryptocurrency lab and co-founders of Interlay, created XCLAIM, the first trustless protocol for cross-chain 'wrapped' assets.\n\nDevelopment started on Polkadot - chosen as the most promising multi-chain project that envisioned a truly decentralized bridge to BTC. In 2020 Interlay built the interBTC (former PolkaBTC) parachain, supported by Web3 Foundation grants and in collaboration with Parity Technologies. interBTC solves challenges related to capital efficiency and decentralization, which other wrapped Bitcoin attempts had failed to crack:\n\nIntegration of staking derivatives for capital efficiency,\n\nTrustless, multi-collateral stake delegation for more decentralization,\n\nMakerDAO-style multi-collateral balancing for peg stability,\n\nOn-chain ECDSA key derivation for better Vault security\u2026\n\nThe result - interBTC is resilient against price fluctuations; vaults will be earning competitive APY, and anyone can become a Vault, anytime.\n\n\"Robust and decentralized infrastructure is a key enabler for a vibrant multi-chain ecosystem. We are very excited to be working with this outstanding team combining the scientific rigour and entrepreneurial spirit,\" said Xinshu Dong, Partner of IOSG Ventures. 'Connecting Polkadot and Bitcoin securely and efficiently is the first strategic move for Interlay, and we're looking forward to a lot of solutions and applications that'd be unlocked by the potential of Interlay's technology.\"\n\nSeed Round\n\nAfter being revenue funded for 1.5 years and growing from 2 to 12 people, Interlay closed a USD 3.04mm equity seed funding round to accelerate growth and expansion to other blockchains beyond Polkadot. By 2022 Interlay plans to grow to 17 people.\n\nInvestors include:\n\nInterchain Grant: To Cosmos and Beyond\n\nIn line with its expansion, Interlay received an Interchain Foundation grant to bring InterBTC to the Cosmos ecosystem.\n\nAs a first step, Interlay will deliver a technical feasibility report on the integration of interBTC with Cosmos \" IBC protocol , and provide a proof of concept implementation. In more detail: Interlay will use the ibc-rs module and the IBC substrate library to move interBTC from its Polkadot parachain to any blockchain supporting Cosmos\" IBC cross-chain interface.\n\ninterBTC: Expansion and Rebranding\n\ninterBTC is a 1:1 Bitcoin-backed asset that enables users to invest, earn and pay with BTC on any blockchain - the true DeFi way:\n\nRadically open : anyone can help secure the system;\n\n: anyone can help secure the system; Secured by insurance: users can exit back to Bitcoin anytime they want, or they will be fully reimbursed.\n\ninterBTC is backed by top-tier research (XCLAIM protocol) and does not require trust in a 3rd party. BTC backing interBTC is kept locked by a decentralized network of collateralized Vaults, and any user can (i) mint interBTC by locking BTC and (ii) run their own Vault.\n\nAs a result, users must only trust that the involved blockchains (Bitcoin, Polkadot, Ethereum, etc.) are operating securely.\n\nConnecting Polkadot and Bitcoin has strategic importance for the Polkadot ecosystem, yet it is only the first step for Interlay, as we are confident that ultimately Interlay will become a synonym for cross-chain communication.\n\nAbout Interlay\n\nInterlay envision a future where blockchains seamlessly connect and interact. Where anyone on any blockchain can use any digital currency and earn on their assets, without restrictions. Our mission is to realize the free nature of BTC and decentralized finance. We work with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polkadot and others. Our flagship product is InterBTC. Anyone on any blockchain can invest and earn. No centralized services. Radically open and secured by insurance. Founded by ex-Imperial College CS PhDs, our products are backed by top-tier scientific papers. We collaborate with leading research labs and tech companies around the world.\n\nContact & Press Kit:\n\nFor more information www.interlay.io\n\nFor media inquiries press@interlay.io\n\nPress kit: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1cxAJy7B7saKfTi7cSH10BDop9KpCQghg\n\nDirector - Judy Yang, judy@iosg.vc\n\nLinks:\n\nWebsite\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTwitter\n\nSOURCE: IOSG Ventures\n\nView source version on accesswire.com:"}, {"headline": "Bitcoin price tumbles to 'final support' as trader warns of $24K BTC price target", "sentiment": "negative", "source": "Cointelegraph", "date": "2 hours ago", "image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/1200_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS91cGxvYWRzLzIwMjEtMDcvMmFmN2M4OTMtYTEyOC00NjYzLTkyZDUtNjk5OGFjNTZlODA4LmpwZw==.jpg", "author": ["William Suberg"], "body": "Bitcoin (BTC) dropped to its \"final support zone\" above $31,000 on July 15 as a low grind downward brought fresh predictions of a BTC price crash.\n\nBTC/USD 1-hour candle chart (Bitstamp).

Therefore, we can expect BTC/USD to move lower later today and reach the next support around $31,000 next.\n\nCryptocurrency heat map. Source: Coin360\n\nThe cryptocurrency market trades with a slight decline over the last 24 hours. Bitcoin has declined by almost 1.8 percent, while Ethereum around 2.3 percent. Binance Coin (BNB) is among the best performers, with a gain of 2.6 percent.\n\nBitcoin price movement in the last 24 hours: Bitcoin sets another lower high\n\nBTC/USD traded in a range of $31,837 \u2013 $33,159, indicating mild volatility. Trading volume has decreased by 9.4 percent and totals $19.7 billion. The total market capitalization trades around $598.7 billion, resulting in market dominance of 45.7 percent.\n\nBTC/USD 4-hour chart: BTC targets $31,000 next?\n\nOn the 4-hour chart, we can see the Bitcoin price rapidly moving away from the $33,000 resistance as bears target the $31,000 support.\n\nBitcoin price action trades with a strong bearish momentum over the past weeks after a new medium-term high was set around $36,500. This followed after another test of the $29,000-$30,000 support at the end of June, indicating that the market still wants to reverse the overall several-month bearish price action.\n\nBTC/USD traded in an increasingly tighter range for most of this month, with a symmetrical triangle pattern formed. However, after another move lower to retest the ascending support trendline, BTC broke lower on the 13th of July.\n\nWhat followed was another clear lower low, around $31,700. From there, BTC/USD rallied yesterday and set a clear lower high around $33,000 overnight. Over the past hours, the Bitcoin price has started to push lower again, and the previous low is currently tested. This price action development should lead BTC/USD towards a lot more downside later today, with the $31,000 support mark targeted next.\n\nBitcoin Price Analysis: Conclusion\n\nBitcoin price analysis is bearish for the rest of the day as a strong push lower was seen over the past hours after a clear lower high was established overnight. Therefore, we expect BTC/USD to push towards the next support around $31,000 next.\n\nWhile waiting for Bitcoin to reach $31,000, read our guides on DeFi advantages, Bitcoin fees, as well as what can you buy with Bitcoin.\n\nDisclaimer.

The bulls are finding some stiff resistance around the $32,758 on the road to recovery and the path of least resistance appears to the upside in the near term amid a favorable bullish technical setup.\n\nBitcoin price Prediction: BTC price Could Head to the North\n\nIn the past few hours, after the Bitcoin price touches the daily low of $31,600, the king coin has been facing the resistance level of $32,800 and looking forward to touching another resistance level of $33,000. However, the daily chart reveals that if the 9-day moving average crosses above the 21-day moving average, this will determine the next direction that the coin will follow. On the other hand, the Bitcoin price may decline if the $32,000 support breaks down but the price could rise if the $35,000 resistance is touched.\n\nMeanwhile, the technical indicator Relative Strength Index (14) is in a range as the signal line point to the east, indicating a sideways movement. Therefore, if the Bitcoin price crosses above the 9-day and 21-day MAs, it could hit the resistance levels of $36,000, $38,000, and $40,000 but moving towards the lower boundary of the channel could meet the supports at $30,000, $28,000, and $26,000.\n\nBTC/USD Medium-Term Trend: Ranging (4H Chart)\n\nAccording to the 4-hour chart, the Bitcoin price is seen rebounding as the technical indicator Relative Strength Index moves above 40-level after the king coin touches the low of $31,600. On the upside, if the Bitcoin price stays above the 9-day MA in the short term, bullish influence could spike and the accrued gains massively.\n\nHowever, the current candle could fall to a tentative support level below the 9-day MA at $32,200. However, the ultimate target remains at $32,000 and below and the best the bulls can do is to hold above the weak support at $33,000 and keep their attention on breaking the resistance at $33,800 and above.\n\nLooking to buy or trade Bitcoin (BTC) now?

The cryptocurrency followed the market trend, remaining on the back foot during the Asian trading session. Shiba INU was created anonymously in August 2020, and soon after its launch, the crypto coin gained the attention of the market, as its prices surged amid headlines from personalities like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and the co-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin. However, now the project is looking to get out of the meme-coin rhetoric, as it has launched its DeFi platform, ShibaSwap. This platform is fully equipped with its own swap interface, budding decentralized autonomous organization structure and yield farming; the platform was launched on the Ethereum network.\n\nSHIB/USD\n\nThe developers behind the dog-themed cryptocurrency launched this much-awaited ShibaSwap DEX on July 6. Recently, the Shiba Inu announced three new pairs on its decentralized exchange, named ETH-USDT, LEASH-BONE, and SHIB-BONE. Despite the addition of new pairs, the coin did not see a bullish movement in its prices. However, the addition should help attract more capital to the exchange, that will add further value to the coin, despite it being a meme-coin.\n\nMeanwhile, Shiba Inu\u2019s official Twitter account tweeted a full audit report for the recently launched ShibaSwap exchange. The recent massive inflows and interest in SHIB/USD could be attributed to two factors, namely the coin being a meme-crypto and the audit report that was launched recently.\n\nThe conditions surrounding the cryptocurrency market have not been supportive, as the BTC/USD has been declining, and the US dollar has also been strong in the market. The greenback has a negative correlation with SHIB/USD, and it has been high against major currencies, with DXY at 92.42; as a result, the SHIB/USD dropped on Thursday.\n\nSHIB/USD \u2013 Technical Outlook\n\nSHIB/USD \u2013 Daily Technical Levels\n\nSupport Resistance\n\n0.00000727 0.00000794\n\n0.00000696 0.00000830\n\n0.00000660 0.00000861\n\nPivot Point: 0.00000763\n\nOn the technical front, the SHIB/USD coin is trading in line with our long-term SHIB/USD forecast for 2021.

Both of these candles support a strong selling trend in the SHIB/USD coin.\n\nBesides this, the downward channel on the 4-hour timeframe also supports a selling bias in SHIB/USD coins.

Prices have fallen abysmally from their previous highs, leaving the global cryptocurrency market cap at $1.3 trillion.\n\nThis pervasive sentiment has led to a spike in the number of short positions for the assets after Bitcoin fell to lows of $28K. Despite the increase in the number of short positions, there is a whirlwind of rumors of massive institutional purchases with Apple said to have splurged over $2 billion on Bitcoin.\n\nRising BTC Short Positions\n\nBTC short positions have been on the rise following Bitcoin\u2019s lackluster performance over the last few months. After surpassing $64K a few months ago, the asset tumbled by over 50% to touch a low of $28,893 that it had not reached since the start of 2021.\n\nWhile the community puts the blame on Elon Musk for statements regarding the network\u2019s environmental sustainability, others are pinning the blame on Chinese regulatory authorities for the sustained crackdown on cryptocurrencies.\n\nBoth of these situations have led to rising short positions as shorts have surpassed the records set in 2019. Over 13,600 BTC/USD shorts have been recorded while 51,000 long positions were observed on the derivatives exchange, Bitfinex. This leaves the market ripe for either a short squeeze or a long squeeze as investors hold their breaths.\n\nApple\u2019s $2.5 Billion Purchase\n\nBitcoin believers are amplifying the rumors of Apple\u2019s $2.5 billion purchase. The exact amount of the purchase is still shrouded in mystery with Galaxy Trading and Chainleak\u2019s CEO putting the figure around $2.5 billion.\n\nProponents of the rumor are citing Apple\u2019s advertisement for a Business Development Manager with expertise in alternative payments. Boxes that must be ticked before the assumption of the role include a five-year experience working with alternative payment providers such as \u201ccryptocurrency\u201d.\n\nRecall that in 2019, VP Apple Pay, Jennifer Bailey said that cryptocurrencies are interesting and they are watching them with keen interest.\n\nOn The Flipside\n\nApple has not released any official announcement concerning a $2.5 billion BTC purchase and by all metrics remains a rumor.\n\nFor all analysts can tell, the pendulum may swing both ways and the market may experience either a long squeeze or a short squeeze.\n\nThe Short Squeeze\n\nWith the speculation around heavy institutional interest in Bitcoin like Apple\u2019s rumor of a $2.5 billion purchase, the market could witness a short squeeze.\n\nThe occurrence of short squeezes in BTC/USD markets is fairly common and in the event, a strong pump will leave short sellers in the mud leading to liquidations.\n\nAlready, firms like Square and MicroStrategy are taking advantage of the dip in prices to bolster their asset base. On June 21, MicroStrategy acquired an additional 13,005 BTC for around $489 million which brings the total amount of BTC owned by the firm to over 105,000 BTC.\n\nAn advertisement for Coin Cloud directed by Spike Lee brings BTC into focus to stimulate the adoption of cryptos. Speaking of the future, the experienced director noted that old money is not going to make things better and added that \u201cthe digital rebellion is here.\u201d\n\nThe short squeeze will trigger a price rally that will inexorably lead to the increase of Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization. Bitcoin has a market capitalization of $611 billion which is a far cry from a former market cap of over $1 trillion.\n\nEMAIL NEWSLETTER\n\nJoin to get the flipside of crypto\n\nUpgrade your inbox and

(BoC) interest rate decision.\n\nThe Bank of Canada anticipates releasing numbers concerning the interest rate decision news on Friday (July 15, 2021). According to economists\u2019 consensus, the central bank\u2019s rate news registered a reading of -0.1% this month while bearing no change compared to the reading of the month before.\n\nThe interest rate decision helps in quantitative easing. If the bank remains hawkish towards the inflationary outlook of the country\u2019s economy and raises interest rates, it signals economic growth. On the other hand, If BoC adopts a dovish view, it means economic contraction. Generally speaking, the higher reading suggests a bearish market for the CAD/JPY currency pair and vice versa.\n\nAs of this writing, the CAD/JPY pair consolidates around 87.58, with multiple resistance levels seen ahead on the daily frame chart. The price might face critical obstruction near these spots(as shown in the given picture).\n\nOn the other hand, there has been upcoming news about retail sales that are projected to release on July 23, 2021, hence there are chances that CAD/JPY might not remain bearish.\n\nConclusion\n\nTaking into account the pair\u2019s price action over the last few days, buying it around the current level could yield some short-term gains."}, {"headline": "Patterns: CAD/JPY, AUD/JPY", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "FXStreet", "date": "9 hours ago", "image": "https://editorial.fxstreet.com/images/Markets/Currencies/Crosses/CADJPY/forex-canadian-and-japanese-currency-pair-with-calculator-4617268_Large.jpg", "author": [], "body": "CAD/JPY breakout could occur\n\nThe Canadian Dollar has edged lower by 3.30% against the Japanese Yen since July 5.

However, with three central bank meetings scheduled for the next 5 trading days, there should be no lack of volatility \u2013 at least in FX.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of New Zealand will announce its rate decision on Wednesday. While no changes to its interest rates are expected, the RBNZ is likely to take a hawkish stance following a series of strong economic data and rising inflation. A rate hike might even arrive later this year.\n\nWith the RBNZ acknowledging the strong economic recovery and an increased risk that inflation might run persistently high rather than just temporary, the market will begin to price in an earlier rate hike. This should give the New Zealand Dollar a boost. But which currency pairs should traders focus on?\n\nNZD/JPY is traditionally seen as a risk barometer, just like AUD/JPY, and it performs exceptionally well when markets are in a \"risk-on\" mode.

The market is expecting that the Bank of Canada will have its first rate hike in the final quarter of 2022. However, rate expectations could increase soon as the central bank begins to taper its asset purchases.\n\nThis would give the Canadian Dollar a boost and aid a recovery from its recent slump against the US Dollar. The recent drop in oil prices and uncertainty surrounding a potential last-minute OPEC+ deal has weighed on the currency.\n\nLooking at the USD/CAD chart, the broad downtrend remains clearly intact, and traders will be keeping a close eye on the 1.2345/65 support zone. A clear break below this area could pave the way for a continuation of the downtrend towards the psychologically important 1.20 level. To the topside, key resistance is seen at 1.26, followed by the 200 DMA - currently residing around 1.2730.\n\nPositive RSI divergence on the CAD/JPY daily chart is hinting at a potential recovery.

Recall that at the April 21st meeting, Canada\u2019s central bank surprised markets by cutting bond purchases from 4 billion Canadian Dollars down to 3 billion Canadian Dollar. However, at their June 9th meeting, they left purchase amounts unchanged as the BOC waited for more data. The Canadian Employment Change for June released on Friday showed that 230,700 jobs were added to the economy, though all the gain was in part-time jobs. The Unemployment Rate fell from 8.2% to 7.8% while Average Hourly Earnings YoY rose from -1.4% in May to +0.1%. Can this data help the BOC with their decision? Markets expect the Bank of Canada to cut bond purchases once again by another 1 billion Canadian Dollars. This would bring totally weekly purchases down to only 2 billion Canadian Dollars! Also, at the June meeting the BOC said that they expect economic slack to be absorbed in the second half of 2022. Watch to see if they revise the timing, which could increase rate hike expectations.\n\nThe BOJ also meets this week. With the Summer Olympics less than 2 weeks away, Japan has imposed a fourth State of Emergency on Tokyo due to the continued spread of the coronavirus. This time, it\u2019s the Delta variant. Could this affect the BOJ\u2019s decisions (although it seems they are running low on options). At their last meeting, the BOJ maintained the target for the 10-year bond at 0% and extended their deadline for the pandemic relief fund by 6 months. Japan\u2019s recent data has been mixed; however, inflation is stagnant. Oil prices are helping to keep inflation near 0%. Monday\u2019s release of Machinery Orders (MoM) for May was strong though, at 7.8% vs 2.6% expected and 0.6% in April! But with little that the BOJ can do, fiscal policy will be watched for additional budgets. With the pandemic continuing and vaccinations low, watch for lower revisions to growth and inflation forecasts.\n\nOn a daily timeframe, the CAD/JPY had moved higher since putting in pandemic lows in March 2020, near 73.80. The pair then traded sideways from June 2020 to February 2021 between 77.60 and 81.91. As yields began moving higher in February of this year, so did CAD/JPY. The pair formed a rising triangle and broke out on February 5th, on its way to June 1st highs near 91.19. Notice that between March 28th and June 1st, the RSI diverged with price which is an indication that a reversal was ahead. The pair has since pulled back to the confluence of the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level from the low on April 21st to the high on June 1st, along with an upward sloping trendline near 87.10. The correlation coefficient between CAD/JPY and the US 10-year yield is currently +0.80. This indicates a strong positive correlation between the 2 assets.\n\nSource: Tradingview, FOREX.com\n\nLast week, Yen pairs had mainly following yields lower. CAD/JPY was no exception. On July 6th, CAD/JPY was trading at 90.10. By the afternoon on July 8th, the pair was at 87.10 before profit taking came in ahead of the weekend. (US 10-year yields were in a similar situation moving from 1.447 down to 1.250 before bouncing. Resistance in CAD/JPY is at today\u2019s highs near 88.56. July 7th highs above there are at 89.12 and then a confluence of resistance between a downward sloping trendline and horizontal resistance between 89.60 and 89.85. Horizontal support is at 87.73 and the July 8th lows of 87.10. If price breaks below, it could then fall to horizontal support near 86.80.\n\nSource: Tradingview, FOREX.com\n\nThere are many events this week which could cause volatility in CAD/JPY. These include the BOC meeting, the BOJ meeting, and the ongoing pandemic. In addition, continued volatility in US yields could cause the pair to move (which could be caused be US CPI, PPI, and Powell\u2019s testimony this week)."}]}, {"id": "CHF/JPY", "price_data":

rate is down -290 pips (-0.02%) from the hour prior. CHFJPY has seen its price go down 4 out of the past 5 hours, thus creating some compelling opportunities for bears. If you\u2019re a trend trader, consider that the strongest clear trend on the hourly chart exists on the 50 hour timeframe. The moving averages on the hourly timeframe suggest a choppiness in price, as the are all in a mixed alignment \u2014 meaning the trend across timeframes is inconsistent, indicating a potential opportunity for rangebound traders.\n\nCHFJPY End of Day Recap\n\nUpdated 00:30 GMT (04:30 EST)\n\nCHFJPY, which opened today priced near 120.344, is down 22 pips 0.18% since the day prior, marking a reversal from the day prior \u2014 and the end of a 3 day positive run. Out of the 39 instruments in the Forex asset class, CHFJPY ended up ranking 23rd for the day in terms of price change. Let\u2019s take a look at price chart of CHFJPY.\n\nCHFJPY Technical Analysis\n\nMoving average crossovers are always interesting, so let\u2019s start there: CHFJPY crossed below its 20 day moving average yesterday. As for the alignment of the moving averages, well, it\u2019s a bit mixed up; the 20, 50, 100, and 200 do not progress from largest to smallest, or vice versa. The closest is the 20 day average, which is 0.1 pips away. Volatility for CHFJPY has been contracting over the past two weeks relative to volatility over the past month. Whether volatility reverts will be something to watch. Trend traders will want to observe that the strongest trend appears on the 30 day horizon; over that time period, price has been moving down. Interestingly, a trend in the other direction exists on the 90 day timeframe, where price is headed up. For additional context, note that price has gone up 6 out of the past 10 days.\n\nThe View From Around the Web\n\nOf note is that traders in aggregate have opinions on CHFJPY, with 3 buy signals on our radar and 11 sell signals. This imputes a buy/sell ratio of 0.27, which is bearish. Here\u2019s a piece we found on tradingview.com; below is a short snippet from it to give you a taste."}, {"headline": "Weekly forex forecast: DXY threatens to reverse lower heading into Tuesday CPI data [Video]", "sentiment": "positive", "source": "FXStreet", "date": "3 days ago", "image": "https://editorial.fxstreet.com/images/Macroeconomics/EconomicIndicator/Prices/CPI/tablet-with-consumer-price-index-cpi-business-concept-gm499730392-80399281_Large.jpg", "author": [], "body": "Markets covered in this week\u2019s weekly forex forecast and forex analysis\n\nUSD (DXY), EurUsd, GbpUsd, UsdChf, UsdJpy, AudUsd, NzdUsd, XauUsd (Gold Analysis), XagUsd, Btc/Usd (Bitcoin), Crude Oil (WTI), SPX (S&P 500), Nasdaq, Nifty, CadChf, CadJpy, AudChf, AudJpy, NzdChf, NzdJpy.\n\nWeekly notes\n\nThe USD Index is in the process of developing a Double Top reversal ahead of important US inflation data coming out tomorrow. Without a confirmed break lower of the Double Top pattern, however, the DXY uptrend remains intact and if it is going to break lower, an overshoot of Inflation, compared to expectations, could well be the catalyst to send the DXY lower over the next month or so.\n\nTalk of Deflation seems premature and the DXY looks to be heading to 88.46 before it starts to rise again, possibly in Q4 of this year.\n\nWith the DXY yet to make up its mind, Swiss Franc & Japanese Yen strength seems to be the overriding theme this week in terms of finding short-term trading opportunities.

US initial jobless claims rose unexpectedly and job opening fell to add further doubt over the economic recovery. Earlier this week the ISM services PMI report also showed that the employment component contracted for the first time this year, falling from 55.3 to 49.3. And the CESI (City Economic Surprise Index) has been falling over the past few weeks which means data is no long surprising to the upside.\n\nAs markets have been getting revved up on the potential for the Fed\u2019s tapering and bond pricing suggests that inflation may indeed be transitory. Yesterday\u2019s employment data appears to be the straw which broke the camels back and saw positions unwound. This is turn can cause a snowball effect as portfolios are readjusted, so volatility on currency markets rose significantly.\n\nGlobal equity markets were all in the red, the Nasdaq banking index fell -1.5% compared with the Nasdaq 100\u2019s -0.6% fall. The S&P 500 was down -0.86% with all 11 sectors closing lower, led by financial and industrial stocks.

As is usually the case during times of turbulence, commodity currencies were offloaded to see NZD, AUD and CAD as the weakest currencies.\n\nNZD/CHF fell over -2% during its most bearish (and volatile) session since March 2020 and AUD/CHF fell around -2% to a 6-month low. The Swiss franc was the favoured safe haven as CHF/JPY actually rose 0.3% despite the ye also taking in safety flows.\n\nThe US dollar index (DXY) fell -0.3% to a two-day low after finding resistance at the 92.78/83 gap on the daily chart. We outlined the potential for the dollar to retrace yesterday but the volatility was much higher than anticipated. Perhaps a base can form at trend support projected from the June 1st low, whilst a break beneath it brings 92.00 into focus (near the 200-day eMA).\n\n\n\n\n\nIncidentally, USD/JPY topped at the March 2020 high (or the pandemic high) and bearish momentum has accelerated to see prices invalidate the bullish channel. To provide perspective, USD/JPY retraced -3.15% in the first three weeks of April, so if we are to see a retracement of similar size then price could fall to around 108.11.\n\nUSD/JPY found support at the 50% retracement level, although traders across Asia are yet to react. However, be warned that volatility can cut both ways during times if turbulence. Therefore, there are two basic approaches to consider on USD/JPY. Bears can either seek continuation patterns on intraday timeframes (pennants, triangles, flags etc) and step aside if bullish momentum returns. Or wait to see if a retracement find resistance, perhaps somewhere around the broken trendline or the 110.21 \u2013 110.67 zone.\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn how to trade forex\n\n\n\n\n\nCommodities escape the wrath of volatile trade:\n\nAll things considered, commodity markets got off lightly as the baulk of volatility was seen across equity and FX markets. Gold was effectively flat although printed another bearish pinbar / Doji and closed beneath the 20, 50 and 200-day eMA\u2019s. Copper printed a bearish inside day yet held above its 100-day eMA (we\u2019re looking for a break beneath 4.20 to suggest another dip lower). Platinum saw an intraday break of its retracement line on the daily chart yet closed on it, so not quite the confirmation we were hoping to see to suggest it was ready to roll over once more.\n\nOil prices were higher as crude and gasoline inventories fell more than expected. Brent rose 1.3% and is currently around 0.6% higher in early Asian trade, so this has invalidated our near-term bearish bias.\n\n\n\n\n\nUp Next (Times in AEST)\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can view all the scheduled events for today using our economic calendar, and keep up to date with the latest market news and analysis here.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to trade with City Index\n\nFollow these easy steps to start trading with City Index today:\n\nOpen a City Index account, or log-in if you\u2019re already a customer.

But with the labour force rising by just 151,000 and still more than three million below its pre-pandemic peak, we aren\u2019t entirely convinced that this is the start of a much stronger trend,\u201d says Andrew Hunter at independent research and consultancy Capital Economics.\n\n\u201cThe key event next week will be the release of the minutes from the Fed\u2019s June meeting, which are likely to provide more details of discussions about asset purchase tapering,\u201d Hunter adds.\n\nWednesday\u2019s minutes are set to hit the wires hard on the heels of June\u2019s non-farm payrolls report, which showed employment rising by almost 1 million last month and lifted the six-month rolling average of payrolls growth to a robust 481k.\n\nAbove: Pound-to-Dollar rate shown at daily intervals with Fibonacci retracements of Feb-to-June rally indicating support levels, alongside selected moving-averages.\n\nAchieve up to 3-5% more currency for your money transfers.

The calendar is quite light, with the highlight probably being the release of the FOMC minutes on Wednesday evening. Much focus will be given to how the doves and hawks are arguing their cases,\u201d Turner adds.\n\nThe Dollar ended last week on its back foot even after Friday\u2019s payrolls surprise, enabling the Pound-Dollar rate to rise back above a 1.38 handle that had appeared in danger of ceding and potentially indicating the directional bias of the U.S. currency ahead of this Wednesday\u2019s minutes, although it\u2019s the market\u2019s reading of and response to the minutes that will dictate how and where GBP/USD ends the week.\n\nThe risk is that Wednesday\u2019s meeting notes bring attention back to bear on the Fed\u2019s $120 billion per month quantitative easing (QE) programme and questions about what would be the most appropriate time to begin winding it down and the pace at which such an exercise should be carried out; potentially leading to increased bond yields and, or a bid for the Dollar in the latter half of the week.\n\nAbove: Pound-to-Dollar rate shown at daily intervals with Fibonacci retracements of correction from early June highs and key moving-averages indicating possible areas resistance to any recovery.\n\n\u201cThe US fiscal stimulus is by far the largest in G10, helping the US outgrow the rest of the world and likely supporting USD this year and possibly next. The Fed is on track to announce tapering at an upcoming meeting, and we continue to think the September meeting is most likely, with tapering starting at the turn of the year,\u201d says Michalis Rousakis, a strategist at BofA Global Research.\n\n\u201cOur key difference with the consensus is that we expect the USD to rally against currencies of central banks that will not be normalizing policies, including EUR, CHF, JPY and SEK, but not necessarily against the rest. Indeed, this is exactly how G10 FX has performed this year, with CAD, GBP, USD and NOK at the top, JPY, CHF, SEK and EUR at the bottom, and AUD and NZD in the middle,\u201d Rousakis adds.\n\nThe Dollar has been lifted in the last month by a lessening of bearish sentiments toward it which was brought about by evolving expectations for Fed policy, with investors and traders increasingly wagering that the bank could raise its interest rate before the end of next year, before lifting it back to 1% by the end of 2023 even as Chairman Jerome Powell poured cold water over other policymakers\u2019 suggestions that any changes to interest rates are in any way likely within this time period.\n\nAbove: Goldman Sachs graph showing market expectations for changes in major central bank policy rats (BoE in red).\n\n\u201cThere are still a number of open questions around the Fed\u2019s balance sheet, including the taper announcement timeline, the duration of the tapering process, and whether the committee will rule out rate hikes while the balance sheet is still growing,\u201d says Zach Pandl, co-head of global foreign exchange strategy at Goldman Sachs.\n\nProspects for U.S. interest rates have dominated the market conversation even as Chairman Powell and others made clear in June that the Fed\u2019s policy priority is the government bond buying programme and its eventual, gradual winding down, details of which may or may not be revealed by Wednesday\u2019s meeting minutes: To the extent that these do reveal anything about the likely timing of a decision by the Fed to reduce its footprint in the U.S. government bond market they will determine whether the Pound-Dollar rate holds onto or gives up the 1.38 handle ahead of Friday\u2019s GDP report.\n\n\u201cMinutes from the June 15-16 FOMC meeting, released on Wednesday, may help clarify Fed officials\u2019 views on the exit path.

The advance is expected to be limited given the overall lack of yield support with gains concentrated against the Euro, yen and Swiss franc.\n\nThe bank expects relatively narrow ranges will prevail in global exchange rates.\n\nUS Dollar Advance against Low-Yield Currencies\n\nBNP Paribas expects that a stronger global economy will be a key driver of exchange rates over the second half of 2021.\n\nAs far as the dollar is concerned, the bank expects that the Federal Reserve will take a measured step towards policy tightening, especially with strong US demand.\n\n\u201cAs the US recovery proceeds and the Fed gets closer to reducing policy accommodation, we expect US real yields to edge up.\u201d\n\nBNP expects that the increase in yields will provide an element of dollar support, but the absolute level of yields will remain relatively unattractive. In this environment, the dollar gains are likely to be concentrated against currencies where central banks will be even slower to tighten monetary policy.\n\nBNP looks at longer-term trends from economic cycles and notes that the dollar tends to strengthen ahead of Federal Reserve interest rate increases before weakening once rates actually increase.\n\n\u201cUSD gains are likely to be most pronounced versus currencies where the market cannot price a meaningful exit from easy monetary policy, notably the CHF, JPY and EUR.\u201d\n\nThe Euro to Dollar (EUR/USD) exchange rate is forecast to weaken to 1.1400 at the end of 2022.\n\nExport Earnings Boost Commodity Currencies\n\nAs the global economy tends to normalise, BNP expects there will be investor support for currencies where there are strong commodity earnings or interest rates are expected to increase.\n\n\u201cIn contrast, we expect a number of emerging market and G10 currencies with commodity exposure or where central banks are likely to hike in tandem with \u2013 or ahead of \u2013 the Fed to hold up well and even outperform the USD.\u201d\n\nIn this context, it expects that commodity currencies will maintain a firm tone and hold their own against the US currency.\n\nPound Sterling (GBP) Exchange Rates Remain Attractive\n\nBNP remains constructive surrounding the Pound Sterling outlook. The bank expects that there is scope for UK yields to increase further as the Bank of England is likely to be one of the early movers in removing policy accommodation.\n\n\u201cComparing the market pricing for rate hikes across the G10, the Bank of England looks conservatively priced, especially considering its less-restrictive forward guidance.\u201d\n\nUK assets continued to under-perform in the 2016-2020 period as Brexit uncertainty curb investor inflows. According to BNP, there is scope for a further catch-up effect over the next few months.\n\n\u201cWe also maintain our positive view on UK equities, as these have lagged the broader rotation into Value stocks, and this could benefit the GBP.\u201d\n\nThe Euro to Pound (EUR/GBP) exchange rate is forecast to weaken to 0.83 at the end of 2022.\n\nAbove: Table of currency forecasts from BNP Paribas covering period 2021-2022."}, {"headline": "Exchange rates predict exchange rates: GBP/USD, USD/CAD, EUR/JPY", "sentiment": "neutral", "source": "FXStreet", "date": "2 weeks ago", "image": "https://editorial.fxstreet.com/images/Markets/Currencies/Majors/GBPUSD/iStock-1088749732_Large.jpg", "author": [], "body": "GBP/USD Vs USD/CAD contained nearly a 2000 pip spread and nonnormal.
